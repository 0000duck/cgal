# This script can be called from a pre-commit hook on either Windows or a Unix
# like operating system.  It implements the checks required to ensure that the
# repository acts in a way which is compatible with a case preserving but
# case insensitive file system.
#
# When a file is added this script checks the file tree in the repository for
# files which would be the same name on a case insensitive file system and
# rejects the commit.
#
# On a Unix system put this script in the hooks directory and add this to the
# pre-commit script:
#
#  $REPOS/hooks/check-case-insensitive.pl "$REPOS" "$TXN" || exit 1
#
# On a windows machine add this to pre-commit.bat:
#
#  perl <path-to-script>\check-case-insensitive.pl %1 %2
