Subject: CGAL 2.2, Computational Geometry Algorithms Library
Body: 
       We are pleased to announce release 2.2 of CGAL, the Computational 
       Geometry Algorithms Library.

       Major additions in this release are:
       o Support for the Borlnd compiler (5.5) on windows and the KAI compiler
         on Solaris.
       o Several optimisation algorithms (smallest enclosing annulus,
         polytope_distance, width of point sets in 3D)
       o Additions to 2d and 3d triangulations and 2d arrangements.
       o Demos showing robustnees problems and their solutions.
       o and more

       The CGAL project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust,
       easy-to-use, and efficient C++ software library of geometric data 
       structures and algorithms. The CGAL library contains:
       o Basic geometric primitives such as points, vectors, lines, predicates
         for testing things such as relative positions of points, and operations
         such as intersections and distance calculation.
       o A collection of standard data structures and geometric algorithms, 
         such as convex hull, (Delaunay) triangulation, planar map, polyhedron, 
         smallest enclosing sphere, and multidimensional query structures.
       o Interfaces to other packages, e.g. for visualisation, and I/O, and 
         other support facilities. 

       For further information and for downloading the library and its 
       documentation, please visit the CGAL web page:
