Subject: CGAL 2.3, Computational Geometry Algorithms Library
Body: 
We are pleased to announce release 2.3 of CGAL, the Computational 
Geometry Algorithms Library.

Major additions in this release include:

o Realization of a new kernel concept that provides more flexibility
  while being completely compatable with the previous design
o d-dimensional kernel, convex hull and Delaunay triangulations
o Redesign of the halfedge data structure to provide better 
  extensibility
o Improvements and additions in 2d and 3d triangulations and 2d 
  planar maps and arrangements.
o Boolean operations on polygons are provided via 2D Nef polyhedra 
o Dependencies on the LEDA library have been removed, except in the
  case of the PostScript stream.

See http://www.cgal.org/releases_frame.html for a complete list of
changes.

The CGAL project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust,
easy-to-use, and efficient C++ software library of geometric data 
structures and algorithms. The CGAL library contains:
o Basic geometric primitives such as points, vectors, lines, predicates
  for testing things such as relative positions of points, and operations
  such as intersections and distance calculation.
o A collection of standard data structures and geometric algorithms, 
  such as convex hull, (Delaunay) triangulation, planar map, polyhedron, 
  smallest enclosing sphere, and multidimensional query structures.
o Interfaces to other packages, e.g. for visualisation, and I/O, and 
  other support facilities.
