Subject: CGAL 3.0.1 Released
Body:

We are pleased to announce the release 3.0.1 of CGAL, the Computational 
Geometry Algorithms Library.  Version 3.0.1 is a bug-fix release for 
version 3.0. No new features have been added in 3.0.1.  Here is the list
of bug-fixes.

Polyhedron:
- Fixed wrong include files for output support. Added example.

Planar_map :
- Fixed the so called "Walk-along-a-line" point-location strategy to
  correctly handle a degenerate case.

Triangulation_2 :
- added missing figure in html doc
- in  Line_face_circulator_2.h :
   Fixed changes made to support handles with a typedef to iterator.
   The fix concerns operator== and !=.

Alpha_shapes_3 :
- fixed classify member function for edges

Number types :   
- Lazy_exact_nt :
  - added the possibility to select the relative precision of to_double()
    (by default 1e-5).  This should fix reports that some circumcenters
    computations have poor coordinates, e.g. nan).
  - when exact computation is triggered, the interval is recomputed, this
    should speed up some kinds of computations.
- to_interval(Quotient<MP_Float>) : avoid spurious overflows.

Kernel :
- missing acknowledgment in the manual and minor clarification of
  intersect() documentation.
