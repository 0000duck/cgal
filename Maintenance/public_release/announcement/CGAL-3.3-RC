Subject: CGAL 3.3 Release Candidate, Computational Geometry Algorithms Library
Body: 

The CGAL Open Source Project is pleased to announce the release candidate
for Release 3.3 of CGAL, the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library.  

You can download the tarball from
ftp://ftp.mpi-sb.mpg.de/pub/outgoing/CGAL/CGAL-3.3-RC1.tar.gz

For Windows we also provide an installer, with precompiled libraries
ftp://ftp.mpi-sb.mpg.de/pub/outgoing/CGAL/CGAL-3.3-Setup.exe

The online version of the manual can be found at

We are looking forward to get your feedback and plan to release CGAL-3.3
one week from today.



Besides improvements of existing packages this release offers
the following new algorithms and data structures.


 o Surface Mesh Simplification 

  This package provides a mesh simplification framework using edge collapse
  operations, and provides the Turk/Lindstrom simplification algorithm.


 o Estimation of Local Differential Properties

  This package allows to compute local differential quantities of a surface 
  from a point sample.


 o Approximation of Ridges and Umbilics on Triangulated Surface Meshes

  This package enables the approximation of differential features on
  triangulated surface meshes. Such curvature related features are
  lines: ridges or crests, and points: umbilics.


 o Envelopes of Curves in 2D

  This package contains two sets of functions that construct the lower and 
  upper envelope diagram for a given range of bounded or unbounded curves.


 o Envelopes of Surfaces in 3D

  This package contains two sets of functions that construct the lower and 
  upper envelope diagram for a given range of bounded or unbounded surfaces. 
  The envelope diagram is realized as a 2D arrangement.


 o Minkowski Sums in 2D

  This package contains functions for computing planar Minkowski sums of two 
  closed polygons,  and for a polygon and a disc (an operation also known as 
  offsetting or dilating a polygon). 
  The package also contains an efficient approximation algorithm for the offset 
  computation,  which provides a guaranteed approximation bound while significantly 
  expediting the running times w.r.t. the exact computation procedure.


 o CGAL and the Boost Graph Library

  This package provides the glue layer for several CGAL data structures such 
  that they become models of the BGL graph concept.
 

 o Spatial Sorting

  This package allows to sort points and other objects along a Hilbert curve
  which can improve the performance of algorithms like triangulations.
  It is used by the constructors of the triangulation package which have
  an iterator range of points as argument.


 o Linear and Quadratic Programming Solver

  This package contains algorithms for minimizing linear and convex quadratic 
  functions over polyhedral domains, described by linear equations and inequalities.
