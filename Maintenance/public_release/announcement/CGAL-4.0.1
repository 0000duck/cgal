Subject: CGAL 4.0.1 Released, Computational Geometry Algorithms Library
Body: 

The CGAL Open Source Project is pleased to announce the release 4.0.1
of CGAL, the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library.  


Version 4.0.1 is a bug-fix release for version 4.0. Apart various minor
fixes in the documentation, the following has been changed since CGAL-4.0:


* 2D Voronoi Diagram Adaptor (re-added)

  - The package 2D Voronoi Diagram Adaptor was temporarily removed from the
    CGAL distribution because of license issues. That package is now back into
    CGAL.


* 2D and 3D Geometry Kernel

  - Fix a bug in the Segment_3-Triangle_3 intersection function in the case the
    segment is collinear with a triangle edge..


* Algebraic Kernel

  - Avoids linking error "duplicate symbols" when two compilation units using
    the algebraic kernel are linked.


* 2D Mesh Generation

  - Fix a compilation error in the header <CGAL/Mesh_2/Do_not_refine_edges.h>
    when g++ version 4.7 is used.


* Surface Mesh Generation and 3D Mesh Generation

  - Fix an important bug in the CGAL_ImageIO library, that could lead to wrong
    result when meshing from a 3D image.

  - Fix the compilation of the demo in demo/Surface_mesher, when Boost version
    1.48 or 1.49 is used.


* 3D Boolean Operations on Nef Polygons Embedded on the Sphere

  - Fix a memory leak due to the usage of an internal mechanism that has been
    replaced by boost::any. This also influences the packages 2D Boolean
    Operations on Nef Polygons, 3D Boolean Operations on Nef Polyhedra, Convex
    Decomposition of Polyhedra, and 3D Minkowski Sum of Polyhedra.


* Surface Mesh Parameterization

  - Fixed a memory leak.


* 2D Arrangement

  - Fixed several memory leaks.
