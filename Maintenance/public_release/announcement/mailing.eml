Body: 

The CGAL Open Source Project is pleased to announce the release 4.5.1
of CGAL, the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library.


Version 4.5.1 is a bug-fix release for version 4.5. The following has been
changed since CGAL-4.5:

  o Support

    - Fix a compilation error when the third-party library TBB version 4.3
      is used.

    - Fix an infinite loop when the parallel version of 3D Mesh Generation
      was compiled using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010.


  o 3D Mesh Generation

    - Fix a bug in the sliver exudation preservation of boundaries.

    - Fix a regression the 1D meshing algorithm that meshes the 1D features
      of the domain.



The CGAL project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust,
easy-to-use, and efficient C++ software library of geometric data
structures and algorithms, like
- triangulations (2D constrained triangulations, Delaunay triangulations
  and periodic triangulations in 2D and 3D),
- Voronoi diagrams (for 2D and 3D points, 2D additively weighted
  Voronoi diagrams, and segment Voronoi diagrams),
- Boolean operations on polygons and polyhedra,
- regularized Boolean operations on polygons with curved arcs
- arrangements of curves,
- mesh generation (2D, 3D and surface mesh generation,
  surface mesh subdivision and parametrization),
- alpha shapes (in 2D and 3D),
- convex hull algorithms (in 2D, 3D and dD),
- operations on polygons (straight skeleton and offset polygon),
- search structures (kd trees for nearest neighbor search, and
  range and segment trees),
- interpolation (natural neighbor interpolation and placement of
  streamlines),
- optimization algorithms (smallest enclosing sphere of points or
  spheres, smallest enclosing ellipsoid of points, principal
  component analysis),
- kinetic data structures
