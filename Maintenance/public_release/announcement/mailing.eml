Subject: CGAL 4.4 Released, Computational Geometry Algorithms Library
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
Body: 

The CGAL Open Source Project is pleased to announce the release 4.4
of CGAL, the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library.

Besides fixes to existing packages, the following has changed since
CGAL 4.3:

  o New compiler support

    The Apple Clang compiler version 5.0 is now supported on
    OS X Mavericks.

    The Microsoft Windows Visual C++ compiler 2013 (VC12) is now supported.


  o Triangulated Surface Mesh Segmentation (new package)

    This package implements the segmentation of triangulated surface meshes
    based on the Shape Diameter Function (SDF). In addition, it also provides
    functions to generate segmentations based on a user defined alternative to
    the SDF.


See http://www.cgal.org/releases.html for a complete list of changes.


The CGAL project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust,
easy-to-use, and efficient C++ software library of geometric data
structures and algorithms, like
- triangulations (2D constrained triangulations, Delaunay triangulations
  and periodic triangulations in 2D and 3D),
- Voronoi diagrams (for 2D and 3D points, 2D additively weighted
  Voronoi diagrams, and segment Voronoi diagrams),
- Boolean operations on polygons and polyhedra,
- regularized Boolean operations on polygons with curved arcs
- arrangements of curves,
- mesh generation (2D, 3D and surface mesh generation,
  surface mesh subdivision and parametrization),
- alpha shapes (in 2D and 3D),
- convex hull algorithms (in 2D, 3D and dD),
- operations on polygons (straight skeleton and offset polygon),
- search structures (kd trees for nearest neighbor search, and
  range and segment trees),
- interpolation (natural neighbor interpolation and placement of
  streamlines),
- optimization algorithms (smallest enclosing sphere of points or
  spheres, smallest enclosing ellipsoid of points, principal
  component analysis),
- kinetic data structures
