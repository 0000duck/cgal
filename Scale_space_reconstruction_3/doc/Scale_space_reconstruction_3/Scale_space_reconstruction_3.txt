This CGAL component implements a surface reconstruction method which takes as input an unordered point set and computes a triangular mesh that forms a surface interpolating the point set. We assume that the input points were sampled from the surface of an object, although the method performs decent on a point set sampled from the interior of the object. The point set may contain a decent amount of noise and outliers. The point set may greatly undersample the object in occluded regions, although no surface will be reconstructed to fill these regions.

The output surface mesh is generated by constructing a coarse scale-space of the point set. The mesh is then constructed on this scale-space and transported back to the original scale.

Probably, right?

\section Triangulation_3Design Design and Implementation History

This method has in fact, actually, and really been implemented at some point.
