\cgalPkgDesc{This method allows to reconstruct a surface in 3D from a set of points. This method provides an efficient alternative to the poisson surface reconstruction method. The main difference in output is that this method reconstructs a surface that interpolates the point set (as opposed to approximating the point set). How the surface connects the points depends on a scale variable, which can be estimated semi-automatically.}

The scale-space surface reconstruction method is twofold: first the point set is transformed into a coarse scale while maintaining point references to the original point set, then the mesh is reconstructed at this coarse scale (where reconstruction problem is less ill-posed) and transported back to the original reference points.

The transformation to the coarse scale is done by projecting each point to the `density`-weighted principal component analysis (PCA) of the local (\f$ \delta \f$-distance) neighborhood. If the high-frequency deformation is significantly smaller than the neighborhood size, the scale is coarse enough for mesh reconstruction after a few iterations of the tranformation step. For the PCA procedure, we use the efficient Eigen libraries. The mesh reconstruction at the coarse scale is performed by filtering a 3D alpha-shape. The result is returned as a collection of triples on the indices of the points. This collection may be sorted per `shell`, where a shell is a collection of connected triangles that are locally oriented towards the same side of the surface.

This method requires a user-specified parameter related to the resolution of the data, but we may be able to estimate this parameter through statistical analysis. Specifically, we use a kD-tree to estimate the mean distance to the n-th nearest neighbor and we use this distance as an approximator for the resolution. Generally a neighborhood containing 30 points is a good estimate. The method generally works well as long as this estimate is not too small and the amount of iterations necessary to reduce the high-frequency signals does not disturb the topology of the data such that back-transportation to the original scale produces too many self-intersections.

The method provides access to intermediate results and the user can adjust these to better suit his needs. These intermediate results are the estimate of the scale variable, the smoothed point set, and the final collection of surface triangles.
