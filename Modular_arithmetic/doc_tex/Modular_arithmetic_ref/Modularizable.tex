\begin{ccRefConcept}{Modularizable}

\ccDefinition

An algebraic structure is called \ccRefName, if there is an suitable mapping into 
an algebraic structure, which is based on the type \ccc{CGAL::Modular}. 
For scalar types, e.g. Integers, this mapping is just the kanonical homomorphism 
into the type \ccc{CGAL::Modular}. For compount types, e.g. Polynomials, 
the mapping is applied to the coefficient of the compount type. 

The mapping is provided via \ccc{CGAL::Modular_traits<Modularizable>}, 
being a model of \ccc{ModularTraits}.
