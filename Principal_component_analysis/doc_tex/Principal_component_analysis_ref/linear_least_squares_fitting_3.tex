\begin{ccRefFunction}{linear_least_squares_fitting_3}  
%% add template arg's if necessary

\ccDefinition
  
The function \ccRefName\ computes the best fitting 3D line or plane of 3D
point sets or triangle sets. The best fit linear sub-space minimizes
the sum of squared distances from the points to their projections onto the
sub-space.

            typename K::FT 
             linear_least_squares_fitting_3(InputIterator first,
                                            InputIterator beyond,
                                            typename K::Line_3 & line,

{ computes the best fitting 3D line of a 3D point set or triangle set in the range
[\ccc{first},\ccc{beyond}). The value returned is a fitting quality
between $0$ and $1$, where $0$ means that the variance is the same
along any line (a horizontal line going through the centroid is output
by default), and $1$ means that the variance is null orthogonally
to the best fitting line. }

The class \ccc{K} is the kernel in which the type
\ccc{InputIterator::value_type} is defined. It can be omitted and
deduced automatically from the value type.

\ccHeading{Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}
   \item  \ccc{InputIterator::value_type} is equivalent to \ccc{K::Point_3} or \ccc{K::Triangle_3}.
   \item  \ccc{line} is the best fitting line computed.
   \item  \ccc{centroid} is the centroid computed. This parameter can be
          omitted.
\end{enumerate}
