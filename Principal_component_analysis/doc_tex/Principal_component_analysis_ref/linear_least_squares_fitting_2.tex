\begin{ccRefFunction}{linear_least_squares_fitting_2}  
%% add template arg's if necessary

\ccDefinition
  
The function \ccRefName\ computes the best fitting 2D line of a 2D
object of Points, Segments, Triangles (filled or hollow), Rectangles(filled or hollow), Circles and Disks. The best fit line minimizes the sum of squared distances
from the points comprising these objects to their projections onto the line.

\ccInclude{CGAL/linear_least_squares_fitting_2.h}

\ccFunction{template < typename InputIterator, typename K> 
            typename K::FT 
             linear_least_squares_fitting_2(InputIterator first,
                                            InputIterator beyond,
                                            typename K::Line_2 & line,
                                            typename K::Point_2 & centroid,     
                                            const K & k,
					    const bool non_standard_geometry);}
{ computes the best fitting 2D line of a 2D object set in the range
[\ccc{first},\ccc{beyond}). The value returned is a fitting quality
between $0$ and $1$, where $0$ means that the variance is the same
along any line (a horizontal line going through the centroid is output
by default), and $1$ means that the variance is null orthogonally
to the best fitting line.
\ccPrecond{first != beyond.} }


The class \ccc{K} is the kernel in which the type
\ccc{InputIterator::value_type} is defined. It can be omitted and
deduced automatically from the value type.

The boolean \ccc{non_standard_geometry} differentiates between filled and hollow objects in the object set. Triangles and Rectangles are considered hollow if its value is set to true, otherwise filled. Circles are considered as disks if its value is set to true, otherwise hollow. It is irrelevant for Points and Segments. It can be omitted and is assumed to be false is that case.

\ccHeading{Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}
   \item  \ccc{InputIterator::value_type} is equivalent to \ccc{K::Point_2}.
   \item  \ccc{line} is the best fitting line computed.
   \item  \ccc{centroid} is the centroid computed. This parameter can be
          omitted.
\end{enumerate}
