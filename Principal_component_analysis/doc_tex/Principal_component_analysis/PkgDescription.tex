\ccPkgSummary{
This package provides functions to compute global informations on the
shape of a set of 2D or 3D objects such as points. It provides the
computation of axis-aligned bounding boxes, centroids of point sets,
barycenters of weighted point sets, as well as linear least squares
fitting for point sets in 2D, and point sets as well as triangle sets
in 3D.}
