\ccPkgSummary{This package provides functions to compute global information on the
shape of a set of 2D or 3D kernel objects. It provides the
computation of axis-aligned bounding boxes for point sets, barycenters
of weighted point sets and centroids as well as linear least squares
fitting for sets of points, circles, rectangles, segments and
triangles in 2D and in addition to these, cuboids, spheres and
tetrahedrons in 3D. It also provides the computation of centroids and
linear least squares fitting for all $n-1$ manifolds of these $n$
dimensional geometries ($n = 2$ or $3$). It assumes the set of kernel
primitive elements to be stored into an iterator range of a
container.}
