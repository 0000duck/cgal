\ccPkgSummary{
This package provides functions to compute global information
on the shape of a set of 2D or 3D objects such as points. It provides the computation of axis-aligned bounding boxes for point sets, barycenters of weighted point sets and centroids as well as linear least squares fitting for sets of points, circles, rectangles, segments and triangles in 2D and in addition to these, cuboids, spheres and tetrahedrons in 3D. It also provides the computation of centroids and linear least squares fitting for all $n-1$ manifolds of these $n$ dimensional geometries ($n = 2$ or $3$). It assumes the set of kernel primitive elements to be stored into an iterator range of a container.}
