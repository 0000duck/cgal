\ccPkgSummary{This package provides functions to compute global information on the shape of a set of 2D or 3D objects. It provides the computation of axis-aligned bounding boxes for point sets, and barycenters
of weighted point sets. In addition, it provides computation of centroids (centers of mass) and linear least squares fitting not only for point sets, but also for other sets of bounded 2D and 3D objects. These objects include segments, circles, disks, rectangles, triangles, cuboids, tetrahedra, spheres and balls. The interface to these functions takes an iterator range of objects.}
