\ccPkgSummary{This package provides functions to compute global information on the shape of a set of 2D or 3D objects. It provides the computation of axis-aligned bounding boxes for sets of bounded objects, and barycenters of weighted point sets. In addition, it provides computation of centroids (center of mass) and linear least squares fitting for point sets as well as for sets of other bounded objects in 2D and 3D. More specifically, these objects include segments, circles, disks, rectangles, triangles, cuboids, tetrahedra, spheres and balls. The common interface to these functions takes an iterator range of objects.}
