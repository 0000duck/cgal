\section{Examples}
\label{subsec:pca_examples}

\subsection{Bounding box of a point set}

In the following example we use \stl\ containers of 2D and 3D points, and
compute their bounding box. The kernel from which the input points
come is automatically deduced by the function.

\ccIncludeExampleCode{Principal_component_analysis/bounding_box.C}

\subsection{Centroid of a point set}

In the following example we use \stl\ containers of 2D and 3D points, and
compute their centroid. The kernel from which the input points
come is automatically deduced by the function.

\ccIncludeExampleCode{Principal_component_analysis/centroid.C}

\subsection{Barycenter of a point set}

In the following example we use \stl\ containers of 2D and 3D weighted points,
and compute their barycenter. The kernel from which the input points come is
automatically deduced by the function.

\ccIncludeExampleCode{Principal_component_analysis/barycenter.C}

\subsection{Best fitting line of a 2D point set}

In the following example we use an \stl\ container of 2D points, and
compute the best fitting line. The kernel from which the input points
come is automatically deduced by the function.
