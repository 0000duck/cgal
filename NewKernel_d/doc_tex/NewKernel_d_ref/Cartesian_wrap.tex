\ccInclude{CGAL/NewKernel_d/Cartesian_wrap.h}
\ccDefinition
This class derives from a \ccc{Kernel} \ccc{Base} and replaces a number
of types (point, segment) with wrappers that have intuitive member
functions that call the corresponding functors. For instance, the
constructors forward to \ccc{Functor<Construct_ttag<Tag>>::type},
\ccc{Point::operator[]} forwards to
\ccc{Functor<Compute_cartesian_coordinate_tag>::type},
\ccc{operator+(Vector,Vector)} forwards to
\ccc{Functor<Construct_sum_of_vectors_tag>::type}, etc.

\ccIsModel
\ccRefConceptPage{Kernel}

\ccImplementation
The implementation \emph{tries} to avoid any extra copying that could be
caused by the wrapping.
