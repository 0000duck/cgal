\begin{ccRefClass}{Cartesian_complete<Base,bool force=false,Derived=Default>}
\ccInclude{CGAL/NewKernel_d/Cartesian_complete.h}
\ccDefinition
A model for \ccc{Kernel}, that takes a \ccc{Kernel} model \ccc{Base}
which provides at least \ccc{Point} and extends it by defining a number
of classical types and functors.  The \ccc{force} parameter says whether
the class should override existing objects from \ccc{Base}.
\ccc{Derived} is the name of the ``final'' class for CRTP patterns,
which by default is \ccc{Cartesian_complete} itself.

This is in particular expected to be enough for the \ccc{Triangulation}
package.

\ccRefConceptPage{Kernel}

\ccImplementation
This is split in classes \ccc{Cartesian_complete_predicates},
\ccc{Cartesian_complete_computations},
\ccc{Cartesian_complete_constructions}, 
\ccc{Cartesian_complete_functors} (a reunion of the previous three), 
\ccc{Cartesian_complete_types}, all with the same parameters.
