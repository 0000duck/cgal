\ccDefinition
A model for \ccc{Kernel}, that takes a \ccc{Kernel} model \ccc{Base}
which provides at least \ccc{Point} and extends it by providing
\ccc{Segment}.
\ccc{Derived} is the name of the ``final'' class for CRTP patterns,
which by default is \ccc{Define_segment} itself.

\ccIsModel
\ccRefConceptPage{Kernel}
\ccRefConceptPage{Segment}

\ccImplementation
The segment type is defined as an \ccc{std::pair} of points.
