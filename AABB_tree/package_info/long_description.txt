This package implements a collision model for polyhedra, using so
called AABB trees.

This package will not be documented for CGAL-3.4. That is currently a tool
used in the Polyhedron Demo to remesh polyhedra. For CGAL-3.5, we hope it
will be documented as a general data structure to compute collision
detections.
