This package implements a collision detection algorithm, using so called AABB trees,
along the lines of

This package will not be documented for CGAL-3.4. It is a stripped down version
of a generic tool (generic in terms of inputs and queries), which is still under 
development. It is already added to the trunk because it is used by the Polyhedron 
Demo to efficiently remesh polyhedral surfaces. 

For CGAL-3.5, we hope to integrate the fully generic version, for triangle soups and polylines, with more queries (intersection, projection), parallelism, etc.
