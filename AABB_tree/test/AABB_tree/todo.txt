test by crossing:

polyhedron data (both triangles and segments) x kernels x query types (ray/line/seg/triangle/plane) x function type (do_intersect, etc..)
- correctness:
  - canonical polyhedron whose intersections are know
  - compare naive (exhaustive) with aabb tree
- speed (to make sure each commits does not mess up the performances)
- memory (to make sure each commits does not mess up the memory consumption)
