\section{Design and Implementation History}
\label{AABB_tree_section_history}

Camille Wormser and Pierre Alliez started to work on this collision detection tool in 2007. The generic design for implementing both intersection and distance queries, and for generic queries and primitives was developed by Camille Wormser.

In 2009, Pierre Alliez, St\'ephane Tayeb and Camille Wormser made the implementation CGAL-compliant, with the help of Laurent Rineau for optimizing the construction.

The authors would also like to thank Andreas Fabri, Jane Tournois, Mariette Yvinec and Sylvain Lefebvre for helpful comments and discussions.
