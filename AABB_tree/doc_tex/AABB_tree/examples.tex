\subsection{Tree of triangles with a copy of geometric data, for line queries and distance queries}
In the following example, a set of 3D triangles is stored in a list. The AABB primitive wraps a triangle as \ccc{datum} and an iterator in the list as \ccc{id}. We compute the number of input triangles intersected by a line query, the closest point from a query point to the input triangles and the squared distance from a query point to the input triangles.

\subsection{Tree of triangles without copying geometric data, for ray queries}
In the following example the AABB primitive wraps a facet handle of a triangle polyhedral surface as \ccc{id} and the corresponding 3D triangle as geometric object. We compute the number of intersections between a ray query and the input primitives, and all intersection objects between a segment query and the input primitives.

\subsection{Tree of segments with a copy of geometric data, for plane queries}
The following example computes the number of intersections between a 3D plane and a set of 3D segments. The segments are stored into a list, and the AABB primitive wraps a segment as \ccc{datum} and an iterator in the list as \ccc{id}.

\subsection{Tree of segments without copying geometric data, for plane queries}
The following example computes the number of intersections between a 3D plane and a set of edges of a triangle polyhedral surface. The AABB primitive wraps a halfedge handle as \ccc{id} and generates a 3D segment on the fly, each time its method \ccc{datum} is called.
