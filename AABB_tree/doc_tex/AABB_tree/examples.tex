In the following example a set of 3D triangles is stored in a list. The AABB primitive wraps a triangle and an iterator in the list. We computes the number of intersections between a 3D line and the input triangles, and the closest point from a query point to the input triangles.

The following example computes the number of intersections between a 3D ray and a set of facets of a triangle polyhedral surface. The AABB primitive wraps a facet handle and generates on the fly a 3D triangle each time its object function is called.

The following example computes the number of intersections between a 3D plane and a set of 3D segments. The segments are stored into a list, and the AABB primitive wraps a segment and an iterator in the list.

The following example computes the number of intersections between a 3D plane and a set of edges of a triangle polyhedral surfaces. The AABB primitive wraps a halfedge handle and generates on the fly a 3D segment each time its object function is called..
