\subsection{Tree of Triangles, for Intersection with Ray Query and Distance Queries}
In the following example, a set of 3D triangles is stored in a list. The AABB primitive wraps a triangle as \ccc{datum} and an iterator in the list as \ccc{id}. We compute the number of input triangles intersected by a ray query, as well as the closest point and the squared distance from a point query.

\subsection{Tree of Polyhedron Triangle Facets for Intersection with Ray and Segment Queries}
In the following example the AABB primitive wraps a facet handle of a triangle polyhedral surface as \ccc{id} and the corresponding 3D triangle as geometric object. We compute the number of intersections with a ray query and all intersection objects with a segment query.

\subsection{Tree of Segments for Intersection with Plane and Triangle Queries, and for Distance Query}
In the following example the segments are stored into a list, and the AABB primitive wraps a segment as \ccc{datum} and an iterator in the list as \ccc{id}. We compute the number of intersections with plane and triangles queries, and the closest point from a point query.

\subsection{Tree of Polyhedron Edge Segments for Intersection with a Triangle Query and for Distance Query}
In the following example the AABB primitive wraps a halfedge handle as \ccc{id} and generates a 3D segment on the fly, each time its method \ccc{datum} is called. We compute the number of intersections with a triangle query and the closest point from a point query.
