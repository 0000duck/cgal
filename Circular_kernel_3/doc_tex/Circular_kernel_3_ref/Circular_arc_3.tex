The circular arc constructed from a circle, a source, and a target, is
defined as the set of points of the circle that lie between the source
\ccc{p1} and the target \ccc{p2}, when traversing the circle
counterclockwise in the \textit{positive} plane containing the circle.

In this definition, we say that a plane is \textit{positive} if its
equation is of the form $ax+by+cz+d=0$ with $(a,b,c)>(0,0,0)$
(i.e. $(a>0) || (a==0) \&\& (b>0) || (a==0)\&\&(b==0)\&\&(c>0)$).

                              const Point_3<SphericalKernel> &r)}
{Constructs an arc that is supported by the circle of type
  \ccc{Circle_3<SphericalKernel>} passing through the points \ccc{p},
  \ccc{q} and \ccc{r}. The source and target are respectively \ccc{p}
  and \ccc{r}, when traversing the supporting circle in the
  counterclockwise direction in the \textit{positive} plane containing
  the circle. 
  Note that, depending on the orientation of the point triple
  \ccc{(p,q,r)}, \ccc{q} may not lie on the arc. 
\ccPrecond{\ccc{p}, \ccc{q}, and \ccc{r} are not collinear.}}

\ccMethod{Circular_arc_point_3<SphericalKernel> target();}{}

When the methods \ccc{source} and \ccc{target} return the same point, then 
the arc is in fact a full circle. %\footnote{so far, arcs of zero length are
%points, not arcs. But see Menelaos' remark: add functors to test whether an
%arc is degenerate... to be fixed}

When the arc was constructed from its (full) underlying circle, then
source and target both return the smallest $x$-extremal point of the
circle if the circle is not contained in a plane $x=A$, and the smallest
$y$-extremal point otherwise.

\ccOperations

\ccFunction{bool operator==(const Circular_arc_3<SphericalKernel> &a1,
			const Circular_arc_3<SphericalKernel> &a2);}
{Test for equality. Two arcs are equal, iff the centers and squared
  radii of their respective supporting circles are equal, and if their
  source and target are equal.} 

\ccFunction{bool operator!=(const Circular_arc_3<SphericalKernel> &a1,
			const Circular_arc_3<SphericalKernel> &a2);}
{Test for nonequality.} 

\ccHeading{I/O}

\ccFunction{istream& operator>> (std::istream& is, Circular_arc_3 & ca);}{}
\ccGlue
\ccFunction{ostream& operator<< (std::ostream& os, const Circular_arc_3 & ca);}{}

The format for input/output is, for each circular arc: a \ccc{Circle_3} 
(the supporting circle) and two \ccc{Circular_arc_point_3} 
(the source and the target), under the condition that the endpoints 
are actually lying on the circle.
