\section{Introduction}

The goal of the 3D spherical kernel is to offer to the user a large set
of functionalities on spheres, circles and circular arcs in the 3D
space, in a similar way as what the 2D circular kernel package (see
Chapter~\ref{chapter-circular-kernel}) does in the plane. All the
choices (interface, robustness, representation, and so on) made here
are consistent with the choices made in the \cgal\ kernel, for which
we refer the user to the kernel manual.

\section{Software Design}

The design of \ccc{Spherical_kernel_3} is similar to the design of
\ccc{Circular_kernel_2}. It has two template parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} the \ccc{LinearKernel}, from which the spherical kernel derives,
provides all elementary geometric objects like points, lines, spheres, and
elementary functionality on them. It must model the \cgal\ three 
dimensional \ccc{Kernel} concept.
%The \cgal\ 2D Kernel can be used as parameter,
%but the user may plug his own kernel 
%instead, as long as it follows the \cgal\ kernel concept. 
\item {} the second parameter is the algebraic kernel, which is 
responsible for computations on polynomials and algebraic numbers. It 
must model the concept \ccc{AlgebraicKernelForSpheres}. The
robustness of the package relies on the fact that the algebraic kernel
provides exact computations on algebraic objects.
\end{itemize}

The 3D spherical kernel uses the extensibility scheme presented in the 
kernel manual (see Section~\ref{section-extensible-kernel}). 
The types of \ccc{LinearKernel} are inherited
by the 3D spherical kernel and some types are taken from the
\ccc{AlgebraicKernelForSpheres} parameter. New main geometric objects are
introduced by \ccc{Spherical_kernel_3}: circles in 3D, circular arcs,
points of circular arcs (used in particular for endpoints of arcs and
intersection points between arcs), and line segments, whose endpoints
are points of this new type.

In fact, the spherical kernel is documented as a concept,
\ccc{SphericalKernel}. One model is currently provided: 
\ccc{Spherical_kernel_3<LinearKernel,AlgebraicKernelForSpheres>}.

\section{Design and Implementation History}

This package follows the 2D circular kernel package (see
Chapter~\ref{chapter-circular-kernel}), which induced the basic
choices of design.

Julien Hazebrouck and Damien Leroy participated in a first
prototype. Sylvain Pion is acknowledged for helpful discussions.
