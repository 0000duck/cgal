\PkgDescriptionEnd

This chapter presents the \cgal range tree and  segment tree data structures.

The range tree is theoretically superior to the \f$ Kd\f$-tree, but the
latter often seems to perform better.
However, the range tree as implemented in \cgal is more flexible than the
\f$ Kd\f$-tree implementation, in that it enables to layer together range trees
and segment trees in the same data structure.
