\section{Delaunay Triangulation}
  
There is a class type with a thourough interface providing the
construction and exploration of closest and furthest site Delaunay
simplicial complexes in arbitrary higher dimension.  The class
\ccc{CGAL::Delaunay_d<R, Lifted_R>}\ccIndexMainItem[C]{Delaunay_d} provides an
implementation via the lifting map to higher dimensional
convex hulls.\ccIndexMainItem{lifting map, dD}.
The class supports incremental construction of Delaunay triangulations 
and various kind of query operations (in particular, nearest and furthest
neighbor queries and range queries with spheres and simplices).
