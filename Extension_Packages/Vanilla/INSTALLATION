#----------------------------------------------------------
#    INSTALLATION for Vanilla CGAL Extension Package
#----------------------------------------------------------

Edit the makefile in this directory as follows:

   (1) Set the value of CGAL_MAKEFILE to the location of the
       proper makefile for the desired platform and compiler
       if this environment variable is not set. (NOTE:  It is 
       better to set this as an environment variable since the 
       cep_test script requires this.)

   (2) Set the value of CGAL_HOME to the root directory for the
       local CGAL installation or establish an environment variable
       with the appropriate value.

   (3) If you would like to use a program other than 'cp' to install
       the extension package (e.g., the 'install') program, change
       the values of INSTALL and INSTALL_FLAGS
   
Compile the library type
    % make

Install the library with
    % make install

This will install the header files for the package in the directory
$(CGAL_HOME)/include/CEP/Vanilla, creating directories that don't
exist.  The libVanill.a library will be installed in 
$(CGAL_HOME)/lib/$(CGAL_OS_COMPILER), where $(CGAL_OS_COMPILER) is
the variable set in the CGAL_MAKEFILE indicating the desired platform-
compiler combination.
