\PkgDescriptionEnd

Scattered data interpolation solves the following problem: given
measures of a function on a set of discrete data points, the task is
to interpolate this function on an arbitrary query point.

If the function is a linear function and given barycentric coordinates
that allow to express the query point as the convex combination of
some data points, the function can be exactly interpolated. If the
function gradients are known, we can exactly interpolate quadratic
functions given barycentric coordinates. Any further properties of
these interpolation functions depend on the properties of the
barycentric coordinates. They are provided in this package under the
name `linear_interpolation` and
`quadratic_interpolation`.
