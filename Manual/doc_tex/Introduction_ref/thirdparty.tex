\section{Third Party Software}

In this section we list the software


\subsection{Standard Template Library \label{thirdparty:stl}}

\cgal\ heavily uses the {\sc Stl}, and in particular adopted
many of its design ideas.   The {\sc Stl} comes with the compiler,
but it is possible to use the compiler together with an
alternative {\sc Stl} implementation.


\subsection{Boost \label{thirdparty:Boost}}

 (www.boost.org).


\subsection{GMP \label{thirdparty:GMP}}

A library for multi precision integers and rational numbers.
\cgal\ offers adapters for these number types.

GMP (www.swox.com/gmp).



\subsection{Leda \label{thirdparty:Leda}}

A library of efficient data structures and algorithms. \cgal\ offers
adapters to the {\sc Leda} number types.

 (www.algorithmic-solutions.com).


\subsection{Taucs \label{thirdparty:Taucs}}

A library of sparse linear solvers.
It can be used by the \ccc{Surface_mesh_parametrization} package.
 (http://www.tau.ac.il/\~stoledo/taucs/).

\subsection{OpenNL \label{thirdparty:OpenNL}}

A solver.

\subsection{zlib \label{thirdparty:zlib}}

A data compression library.
It is used in the examples of the \ccc{Surface_mesher} package.

 (www.gzip.org/zlib).

\subsection{Qt \label{thirdparty:Qt}}

A {\sc Gui} library.   It is used in all 2D demos.

 (www.trolltech.com).


\subsection{Coin \label{thirdparty:Coin}}
