This directory contains the test suite for the Arrangement_2 package. In
particular a list of tests follows:

tst01 - Construct an arrangement using incremental insertion of (x-monotone)
        segments that do not intersect in their interiors.

	Print out the number of features (i.e., Faces, Halfedges, and Faces)
	(This could be split into a separate test).

	Issue point location and vertical-ray shooting queries, and print
	out the results.

	Run the test with all combinations of traits that support segments
	(i.e., Segment, Kernel-Segment, Conic, and Polyline), and supported
	point-location strategies (i.e., Trapezoidal-RIC, Naive, Walk, and
	Landmark).

tst02 - Construct an arrangement using incremental insertion of (x-monotone)
        segments that do not intersect in their interiors.

	Split and merge edges.

	Run the test with all combinations of traits that support segments
	(i.e., Segment, Kernel-Segment, Conic, and Polyline), and supported
	point-location strategies (i.e., Trapezoidal-RIC, Naive, Walk, and
	Landmark).
	
tst03 - Construct an arrangement using incremental insertion of (x-monotone)
        segments that do not intersect in their interiors.

	Test:
	1. vertices traversal
	2. halfedge around vertex traversal
	3. connected component of the boundary traversal
	4. holes traversal
	5. halfedges traversal
	6. edges traversal (missing)

	Run the test with all combinations of traits that support segments
	(i.e., Segment, Kernel-Segment, Conic, and Polyline), and supported
	point-location strategies (i.e., Trapezoidal-RIC, Naive, Walk, and
	Landmark).

tst04 - Construct an arrangement using incremental insertion of (x-monotone)
        segments that do not intersect in their interiors.

	Remove halfedge

	Run the test with all combinations of traits that support segments
	(i.e., Segment, Kernel-Segment, Conic, and Polyline), and supported
	point-location strategies (i.e., Trapezoidal-RIC, Naive, Walk, and
	Landmark).
