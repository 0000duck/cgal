\section{Input/Output Functions\label{arr_sec:io}}
%===============================

In some cases, we would like to reuse an arrangement instance constructed
by our application in the future --- for example, our arrangement may
represent a very complicated geographical map and we have various
applications that need to answer point-location queries on this map.
Naturally, we can store the set of curves that induces the arrangement,
but this implies that we need to construct the arrangement from
scratch each time we need to reuse it. A more efficient solution would
be to save the arrangement to a file, so that other application can
reread it from there.

We provide an {\em inserter} (the \ccc{<<} operator) and an {\em extractor}
(the \ccc{>>} operator) for the \ccc{Arrangement_2<Traits,Dcel>} class,
such that an arrangement instance can be inserted into an output stream
or read from an input stream. The arrangement is written using a simple
predefined textual format that encodes the arrangement topology, as
well as all geometric entities associated with vertices and edges.

To use the input/output operators, we require that the \ccc{Point_2} type
and the \ccc{X_monotone_curve_2} type defined by the traits class both
support the \ccc{<<} and \ccc{>>} operators. The \ccc{Arr_conic_traits_2}
class (see Section~\ref{arr_ssec:tr_conic}) and the 
\ccc{Arr_rational_arc_traits_2} class (see Section~\ref{arr_ssec:tr_ratfunc})
currently do not provide these operator for the geometric types
they define, so only arrangements of line segments or of polylines can
be written or read.

The following example constructs the arrangement depicted in 
Figure~\ref{arr_fig:ex_5} and writes it to an output file. It also
demonstrates how to re-read the arrangement from a file:

\ccIncludeExampleCode{../examples/Arrangement_2/ex_io.C}

\subsection{Arrangements with Auxiliary Data\label{arr_ssec:arr_io_aux_data}}
%--------------------------------------------

The inserter and extractor both ignore any auxiliary data stored with
the arrangement features, thus they are ideal for arrangements
instantiated using the \ccc{Arr_default_dcel} class.
However, as explained in Section~\ref{arr_sec:ex_dcel}, one can easily
extend the arrangement faces by using the \ccc{Arr_face_extended_dcel}
template, or extend all \dcel\ records by using the \ccc{Arr_extended_dcel}
template. In such cases, it may be crucial that the auxiliary data fields
are written to the file or read from there.

The arrangement package includes the free functions
\ccc{write(arr, os, formatter)}, which writes the arrangement \ccc{arr}
to an output stream \ccc{os}, and \ccc{read(arr, os, formatter)}, which
reads the arrangement \ccc{arr} from an input stream \ccc{is}. Both
operations are performed using a \ccc{formatter} object, which defines
the I/O format. The package contains three formatter classes:
\begin{itemize}
\item \ccc{Arr_text_formatter<Arrangement>} defines a simple textual
I/O format for the arrangement topology and geometry, disregarding any
auxiliary data that may be associated with the arrangement features.
This is the default formatter used by the arrangement inserter and the
arrangement extractor, as defined above.
%
\item \ccc{Arr_face_extended_text_formatter<Arrangement>} operates on
arrangements whose \dcel\ representation is based on the
\ccc{Arr_face_extended_dcel<Traits,FaceData>} class (see
Section~\ref{arr_ssec:ex_dcel_face}). It supports reading and writing
the auxiliary data objects stored with the arrangement faces provided
that the \ccc{FaceData} class supports an inserter and an extractor.
%
\item \ccc{Arr_extended_dcel_text_formatter<Arrangement>} operates on
arrangements whose \dcel\ representation is based on the
\ccc{Arr_extended_dcel<Traits,VertexData,HalfedgeData,FaceData>} class
(see Section~\ref{arr_ssec:ex_dcel_all}). It supports reading and writing
the auxiliary data objects stored with the arrangement vertices, edges
and faces, provided that the \ccc{VertexData}, \ccc{HalfedgeData} and
\ccc{FaceData} classed all have inserters and extractors.
\end{itemize}

The following example constructs the same arrangement as the
example \ccc{ex_dcel_extension} does
(see Section~\ref{arr_ssec:ex_dcel_all}) which is depicted in
Figure~\ref{arr_fig:ex_20}, and writes it to an output file. It also
demonstrates how to re-read the arrangement from a file:

\ccIncludeExampleCode{../examples/Arrangement_2/ex_dcel_extension_io.C}

External users may write their own formatter classes by implementing
models to the \ccc{ArrangementInputFormatter} and the
\ccc{ArrangementOutputFormatter}, as defined in the Reference Manual.
Doing so, they can define other I/O formats, such as an XML-based
format or a binary format.
\end{ccAdvanced}

\subsection{Arrangements with Curve History\label{arr_ssec:arr_io_hist}}
%-------------------------------------------

In Section~\ref{arr_sec:arr_with_hist} we introduced the
\ccc{Arrangement_with_history_2<Traits,Dcel>} class that stores the
set of curves inducing the arrangement and maintains the relations between
these curves and the edges they induce. Naturally, when reading or writing an
arrangement-with-history instance we would like this information to be
written to the output stream or retrieved from the input stream alongside
with the basic arrangement structure.

The arrangement package supplies an inserter and an extractor for the
\ccc{Arrangement_with_history_2<Traits,Dcel>} class. The arrangement is
represented using a simple predefined textual format, where we require that
the \ccc{Curve_2} type defined by the traits class --- as well as the
\ccc{Point_2} type and the \ccc{X_monotone_curve_2} types --- support
the \ccc{<<} and\ccc{>>} operators.

The following example constructs the same arrangement as example
\ccc{ex_curve_history} does
(see Section~\ref{arr_ssec:arr_hist_ex}) which is depicted in
Figure~\ref{arr_fig:ex_24}, and writes it to an output file. It also
demonstrates how to re-read the arrangement-with-history from a file:

\ccIncludeExampleCode{../examples/Arrangement_2/ex_io_curve_history.C}

\begin{ccAdvanced}
The arrangement package also includes the free functions
\ccc{write(arr, os, formatter)} and \ccc{read(arr, os, formatter)} that
operate on a given arrangement-with-history instance \ccc{arr}.
Both functions are parameterized by a \ccc{formatter} object, which define
the I/O format. The package contains a template called,
\ccc{Arr_with_hist_text_formatter<ArranagmentFormatter>}, which extends
an arrangement formatter class (see Section~\ref{arr_ssec:arr_io_aux_data})
and defines a simple textual input/output format.
