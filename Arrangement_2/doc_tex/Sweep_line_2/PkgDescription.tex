\begin{ccPkgDescription}{Arrangement\label{Pkg:Arrangement2}}
\ccPkgSummary{This package provides three free functions implemented
based on the sweep-line paradigm: given a collection of input curves,
compute all intersection points, compute the set of subcurves that are
pairwise interior-disjoint induced by them, and check whether there
is at least one pair of curves among them that intersect in their
interior.}
