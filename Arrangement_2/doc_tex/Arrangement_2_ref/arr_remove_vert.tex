\begin{ccRefFunction}{remove_vertex}

\ccDefinition

Attempts to removed the vertex \ccc{v} from the given arrangement \ccc{arr}.
The vertex can be removed if it is either an isolated vertex and has no
incident edge, or if it is a {\sl redundant} vertex --- that is, it has
exactly two incident edges whose associated curves can be merged to form
a single $x$-monotone curve. The assumption is that \ccc{Traits} is a
model of the refines \ccc{ArrangementXMonotoneTraits_2}, such that it
supports merge operations on $x$-monotone curves.
The function returns whether it succeeded in deleting \ccc{v} from the
arrangement.
