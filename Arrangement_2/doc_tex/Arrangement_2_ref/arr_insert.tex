\begin{ccRefFunction}{insert_curve}

\ccDefinition

Inserts the given curve \ccc{c} into the arrangement \ccc{arr}, where
no restrictions are made on the nature of the inserted curve.
The \ccc{Traits} parameter must be a model of the
\ccc{ArrangementTraits_2}
concept. That is, it should define the \ccc{Curve_2} type and support
its subdivision into $x$-monotone subcurves (and perhaps isolated points).
Each subcurve is in turn inserted into the arrangement by locating its
left endpoint and computing its zone until reaching the right endpoint.
The point-location object \ccc{pl}, which must be a model of the
\ccc{ArrangementPointLocation_2} concept, is used for answering
point-location queries during the insertion process.
By default, the function uses the ``walk along line'' point-location
strategy --- namely an instance of the class
\ccc{Arr_walk_along_line_point_location<Arrangement_2<Traits,Dcel> >}.

% Inserts the given curve \ccc{c} into the arrangement \ccc{arr}, where

Inserts the given curve \ccc{c} into the arrangement \ccc{arr}, and returns
a handle to the inserted curve.
The point-location object \ccc{pl}, which should be a model of the
\ccc{ArrangementPointLocation_2} concept, is used for answering
point-location queries during the insertion process.
By default, the function uses the ``walk along line'' point-location
strategy --- namely an instance of the class
\ccc{Arr_walk_along_line_point_location<Arrangement_with_history_2<Traits,Dcel> >}.
