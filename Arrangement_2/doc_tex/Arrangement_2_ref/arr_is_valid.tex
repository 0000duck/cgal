\begin{ccRefFunction}{is_valid}

\ccDefinition

Checks the validity of the given arrangement. It first invokes the
member function \ccc{arr.is_valid()} to ensure the topological correctness
of the arrangement. Then it performs additional validity tests. First, it
checks that all $x$-monotone curves associated with arrangement edges are
pairwise disjoint in their interior. Then it makes sure that all holes and
all isolated vertices are located within the proper arrangement faces.
The traits class in use must be a model of the concept
\ccc{ArranagmentXMonotoneTraits_2}. Note that the test carried out by this
functions may take a considerable amount of time; it should therefore be
used only for debugging purposes.
