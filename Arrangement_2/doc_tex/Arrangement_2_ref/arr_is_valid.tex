\begin{ccRefFunction}{is_valid}

\ccDefinition

The function \ccRefName{} checks the validity of a given arrangement.

\ccInclude{CGAL/Arrangement_2.h}

\ccGlobalFunction{template<typename Traits, typename Dcel>
                  bool is_valid (const Arrangement_2<Traits, Dcel>& arr);}

Invokes the member function \ccc{arr.is_valid()} to verify the
topological correctness of the arrangement. Then it performs additional
validity tests. It checks that all $x$-monotone curves associated with
arrangement edges are pairwise disjoint in their interior. Then it makes
sure that all holes and all isolated vertices are located within the
proper arrangement faces. Note that the test carried out by this
function may take a considerable amount of time; it is recommended to be
used only for debugging purposes.

\ccRequirements
The instantiated traits class must model the concept
\ccc{ArranagmentXMonotoneTraits_2}.
