\ccDefinition

Inserts the given $x$-monotone curve \ccc{xc} into the arrangement
\ccc{arr}, where the interior of \ccc{xc} is disjoint from all existing
arrangement vertices and edges. Under this assumption, it is possible to
locate the endpoints of \ccc{xc} in the arrangement and use one of the
specialized insertion member-functions of \ccc{arr} according to the
results. As no intersection are computed, the \ccc{Traits} parameter
must model the restricted \ccc{ArrangementBasicTraits_2} concept.
The point-location object \ccc{pl}, which must model the
\ccc{ArrangementPointLocation_2} concept, is used for answering
the two point-location queries on \ccc{xc}'s endpoints. The insertion
operations creates a single new edge, that is, two twin halfedges,
and the function returns a handle for the one directed
lexicographically in increasing order (from left to right).
By default, the function uses the ``walk along line'' point-location
strategy --- namely, an instance of the class
\ccc{Arr_walk_along_line_point_location<Arrangement_2<Traits,Dcel> >}.
