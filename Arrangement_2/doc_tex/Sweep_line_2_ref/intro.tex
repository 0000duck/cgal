\chapter{2D Intersection of Curves}
\ccChapterAuthor{Baruch Zukerman \and Ron Wein}

\subsection*{Introduction}

This chapter describes three functions implemented using the
sweep-line algorithm: given a collection ${\mathcal C}$ of 
planar curves, compute all intersection points among them,
obtain the set of maximal pairwise interior-disjoint subcurves
of the curves in ${\mathcal C}$, or check whether there is at
least one pair of curves in ${\mathcal C}$ that intersect in
their interior.

The first two operations are performed in an output-sensitive
manner.
