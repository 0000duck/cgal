`CGAL::monotone_matrix_search` and `CGAL::sorted_matrix_search` 
are techniques that deal with the problem of efficiently finding
largest entries in matrices with certain structural properties. Many
concrete problems can be modelled as matrix search problems, and for
some of them we provide explicit solutions that allow you to solve
them without knowing about the matrix search technique. Examples are,
the computation of all furthest neighbors for the vertices of a convex
polygon, maximal \f$ k\f$-gons inscribed into a planar point set, and
computing rectangular \f$ p\f$-centers.
