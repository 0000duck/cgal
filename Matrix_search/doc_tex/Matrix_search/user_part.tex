%% Geometric optimization is a well-studied subject also in theory.
%% Consequently, general design principles have been developed from which
%% solutions to diverse problems arise. For example, although the
%% problems of computing the smallest enclosing sphere of a point set and
%% the problem of computing the distance between two convex hulls seem to
%% be quite different, they are both instances of a more general
%% optimization problem, named ``quadratic programming''. To be more
%% specific, \cgal's solutions for the two quadratic programming
%% instances just mentioned are based on a general quadratic programming
%% solver, which will be documented as a separate unit in future
%% releases.

%% This section provides interfaces to several such general techniques as
%% well as additional concrete optimization algorithms that derive from
%% these general techniques.

%% To be more specific, \cgal's solutions for the two quadratic
%% programming instances just mentioned are based on a general quadratic
%% programming solver, which itself is available as an advanced
%% technique.  This means, using \cgal, you can solve your favorite
%% quadratic program, even if it does not assume the form of one of the
%% optimization problems that we explicitly address! A word of warning is
%% in order: the interface of the quadratic programming solver has mainly
%% been developed for internal use by the \cgal\ developers community. In
%% particular, feedback from the developers has influenced (and will
%% further influence) its design. This means: you are welcome to use the
%% solver's interface, but if you do so, please be aware that it might
%% change in the future, making adaptions of your code necessary. In the
%% future, the interface and the functionality will stabilize.


\ccc{CGAL::monotone_matrix_search} and \ccc{CGAL::sorted_matrix_search} 
are techniques that deal with the problem of efficiently finding
largest entries in matrices with certain structural properties. Many
concrete problems can be modelled as matrix search problems, and for
some of them we provide explicit solutions that allow you to solve
them without knowing about the matrix search technique. Examples are,
the computation of all furthest neighbors for the vertices of a convex
polygon, maximal $k$-gons inscribed into a planar point set, and
computing rectangular $p$-centers.
