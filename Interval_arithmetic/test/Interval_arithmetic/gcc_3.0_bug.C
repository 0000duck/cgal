/*
  This test file has been distilled from a bug-report from Matthias.
  Probably a GCC 3.0.4 code generation bug.
  It shows up only with -O -DNDEBUG.
  It goes away when :
  - operator-(Interval) is not inline
  - copy ctor of Interval_base is written explicitly.

I've changed one of the examples from the Triangulation_3 examples a bit
and it shows the same behavior.

When I compile with -DNDEBUG it loops; removing -DNDEBUG from the
makefile makes it work. I attach the makefile and the example.
