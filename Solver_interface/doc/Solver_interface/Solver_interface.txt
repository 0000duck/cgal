Several \cgal packages have to solve linear systems with dense or sparse matrices.
This package provides concepts and models for that purpose. The models we provide
all use the \ref thirdpartyEigen library. It is straightforward to develop
equivalent models for other solvers, for example those found in the
<a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl">Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL)</a>.



\section SectionSolverEigenSparse Eigen Sparse Solvers

An interface to all sparse solvers from the \ref thirdpartyEigen
library is provided through the class
`Eigen_solver_traits<T>`. This solver traits class can be used for an
iterative or a direct, symmetric or general sparse solvers. The 
specific solver to be used must be given as template
parameter.

Each \cgal package using a sparse solver specifies which type of matrix
and solver is required.

Here are few examples: 

\code{.cpp} 

typedef CGAL::Eigen_sparse_matrix<double>::EigenType EigenMatrix; 

//iterative general solver 
typedef CGAL::Eigen_solver_traits< Eigen::BiCGSTAB<EigenMatrix> > Iterative_general_solver; 

//iterative symmetric solver 
typedef CGAL::Eigen_solver_traits< Eigen::ConjugateGradient<EigenMatrix> > Iterative_symmetric_solver; 

//direct symmetric solver 
typedef CGAL::Eigen_solver_traits< Eigen::SimplicialCholesky<EigenMatrix> > Direct_symmetric_solver; 

\endcode

\section SectionSolverEigenSVD Eigen Singular Value Decomposition

The class `Eigen_svd` provides an algorithm to solve in the least
square sense a linear system with a singular value decomposition using
\ref thirdpartyEigen. The field type is `double`.

Here is a simple example that shows how to handle matrices, vectors
and this solver:

\cgalExample{Solver_interface/eigen_singular_value_decomposition.cpp}

\section SectionSolverEigenVCM Variance Covariance Matrix

The class `Eigen_vcm_traits<T>` provides an interface to the
selfadjoint solver of the \ref thirdpartyEigen library.
