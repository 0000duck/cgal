 
INSTALL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file describes how to install CGAL.

The documentation of CGAL is available in various formats (HTML,
PostScript, PDF). It is not bundled with the software but can be
downloaded separately at <http://www.cgal.org/Manual>.

For more information about CGAL, see the <http://www.cgal.org/>.


To install CGAL, you should:

 --------------------------- 
 - setup the pre-requisites:
 ---------------------------
  
   * install CMake 2.4.7 or later (www.cmake.org)
     CMake is the build system used by CGAL.
     
   * install the Boost libraries (www.boost.org)
     Boost is required to build CGAL.
     
   * install optional additional libraries:
        
       - qt3 (trolltech.com/products/qt)
       
           Used by most Demos
           
       - gmp   (gmplib.org)
       - mpfr  (www.mpfr.org)
       - leda  (www.algorithmic-solutions.com/leda/index.htm)
       
           Used for exact arithmetic
       
     
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 - download the compressed archive file from the CGAL web site http://www.cgal.org
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
 ------------------
 - unpack the file
 -----------------

 ------------------------------ 
 - configure the CGAL libraries
 ------------------------------ 
 
    for a single configuration you can run the following command 
    from the root folder:
    
       cmake . (notice the "current directory" argument)
     
    for a multi-configuration (different compilers, or release/debug, etc) you need to:
     
      create a folder for each configuration and from within that folder
      run the following command:
      
        cmake <path-to-cgal-root>
        
    if you see any errors during configuration, run cmake again with the same arguments.
    (CMake uses a cache system that might require a second pass through it)
    
    CMake will try to locate the libraries used and required
    by CGAL. These libraries are detailed in the CGAL install notes at
    <http://www.cgal.org/Manual/doc_html/installation_manual/contents.html>.
        
  -------------------------------------- 
  - build and install the CGAL libraries 
  -------------------------------------- 
  
    run the following commands from the configuration folder 
    (or the root folder if a single configuration was used)
  
        make
        make install
        
  --------------------------------------------- 
  - configure and build applications using CGAL
  - (such as demos, examples, etc)        
  ---------------------------------------------
  
    set CGALROOT to a given configuration folder.
    
    for example, if you built a debug version by running
    
       cmake ../../..
    
    under folder
    
      CGAL-3.4/cmake/platforms/debug
      
    type
      
      export CGALROOT=CGAL-3.4/cmake/platforms/debug
       
    Or, if you built cgal for a single configuration
    running "cmake ." directly from CGAL-3.4,
    type:
    
      export CGALROOT=CGAL-3.4
      
    cd into the folder containing the CGAL application.
    for example:
      
      cd CGAL-3-4/demo/Alpha_shapes_2
       
    run cmake "in-source" (passing the current folder as argument)
       
      cmake .
      
    build the application
      
      make
      



NOTE ON CMAKE: CMake is a paltform independent makefile generator.
Type "cmake" (without arguments) to see a list of options.
There are a number of choices for building CGAL that can be configured 
running "CMakeSetup", a GUI-based configuration editor.
When the editor is launched, all available choices are displayed along
with their current values.
You can use that editor, for instance, to override or define the path
to a third party library such as gmp, or to enable/disable a
library such as CGAL_IMAGE_IO.


NOTE ON REPEATED INSTALLS: CMake maintains a file named
CMakeCache.txt in "configuration folder" (where cmake is run)
which records which external libraries were found as
well as the relevant environment variables and choices. 
The cached values are used on subsequent runs of cmake on the same 
configuration. Delete the file CMakeCache.txt directly if the environment
has changed (for example, boost or GMP was installed) and you
want cmake to pick up these changes.
