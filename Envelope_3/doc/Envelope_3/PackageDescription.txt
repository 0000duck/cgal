\PkgDesc{This package consits of functions that compute the lower (or upper) envelope of a set of arbitrary surfaces in 3D. The output is represented as an 2D envelope diagram, namely a planar subdivision such that the identity of the surfaces that induce the envelope over each diagram cell is unique.}

This package consists of functions that compute the lower (or upper)
envelope of a set of arbitrary surfaces in 3D. The output is
represented as an 2D envelope diagram  -  a planar subdivision such
that the identity of the surfaces that induce the envelope over each
diagram cell is unique.
