\ccPkgSummary{

Visualizing vector fields is important for many application domains. A
good way to do it is to generate streamlines that describe the flow
behaviour. This package implements the "Farthest Point Seeding"
algorithm for placing streamlines in 2D vector fields. It generates a
list of streamlines corresponding to an input flow using a specified
separating distance. The algorithm uses a Delaunay triangulation to
model objects and adress different queries, and relies on choosing the
centers of the biggest empty circles to start the integration of the
streamlines.
