\PkgDesc{This package allows to build a triangular mesh of a skin surface.     Skin surfaces are used for modeling large molecules in biological     computing. The surface is defined by a set of balls, representing     the atoms of the molecule, and a shrink factor that determines the     size of the smooth patches gluing the balls together.      The construction of a triangular mesh of a smooth skin surface is     often necessary for further analysis and for fast visualization.     This package provides functions to construct a triangular mesh     approximating the skin surface from a set of balls and a shrink     factor. It also contains code to subdivide the mesh efficiently.     }

\PkgDescriptionEnd

Skin surfaces form a class of tangent continuous surfaces defined by a
set of balls and a scalar called the shrink factor. The skin surface
package constructs a triangular mesh isotopic to the skin surface,
using the algorithm described in \cite cgal:kv-mssct-05. The mesh is
stored in a `CGAL::Polyhedron_3`.
