\ccPkgSummary{
This package provides algorithms for computing bounding volumes, inscribed areas and polytope distances.

The algorithms for bounding volumes for point sets in
 d-dimensional space are: the smallest enclosing sphere, annulus,
 ellipsoid, or strip. For 2-dimensional space, a number of additional
 volumes (rectangles, parallelograms, $k=2,3,4$ axis-aligned rectangles) 
are available.
The smallest enclosing sphere algorithm can also be applied
on a set of d-dimensional spheres. 

The algorithms for computing inscribed areas are: the largest inscribed
k-gon (area or perimeter) of a convex point set and the largest inscribed rectangle.

The polytope distance algorithm computes the distance between the
convex hulls of two point sets in d-dimensional space, without
explicitely constructing the convex hulls. 

Finally this package offers a matrix search framework, which is
the underlying machinery of some of the algorithms of this package.}
