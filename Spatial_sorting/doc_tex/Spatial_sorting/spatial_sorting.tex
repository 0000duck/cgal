\section{Spatial Sorting}
\label{sec:spatial_sorting}

\cgal\ provides a small set of sorting algorithms, currently implemented only for 2D and 3D points, although it is easy to extend them to other objects through a traits mecanism.

Given an iterator range of points, the function \ccc{hilbert_sort} sorts them
along the famous space-filling Hilbert curve.
Combined with a \ccc{std::random_shuffle}, the function \ccc{spatial_sort} will
sort points in a way keeping enough randomness to retain theoritical optimality
for some algorithm\footnote{in fact, this has only been proved for Delaunay triangulation},
and close enough to a space-filling curve to speed-up algorithms.

This an example that can dramatically speeds up Delaunay triangulation constructions.
