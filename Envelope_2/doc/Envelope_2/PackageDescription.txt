\PkgDesc{This package consits of functions that computes the lower (or upper) envelope of a set of arbitrary curves in 2D. The output is represented as an envelope diagram, namely a subdivision of the \f$ x\f$-axis into intervals, such that the identity of the curves that induce the envelope on each interval is unique.}

\PkgDescriptionEnd

This package consists of functions that compute the lower (or upper)
envelope of a set of arbitrary curves in 2D. The output is
represented as an envelope diagram, namely a subdivision of the
\f$ x\f$-axis into intervals, such that the identity of the curves that
induce the envelope over each interval is unique.
