\ccPkgSummary{This \cgal\ component implements methods to analyze and process unorganized point sets. The input is an unorganized point set, possibly with attributes such as unoriented or oriented normals. This point set can be analyzed to measure certain properties such as average spacing. We can furthermore process the point set with functions devoted to the simplification, outlier removal, smoothing, normal estimation and normal orientation.}
