\section{Analysis}

The purpose of the analysis stage is to measure common statistics and bounding volumes over the input points so as to automatically determine parameters for subsequent stages:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Point set barycenter, bounding box,
        bounding sphere (provided by other \cgal\ components).
  \item Average spacing to the $k$ nearest neighbors.
\end{itemize}

\ccc{CGAL::compute_average_spacing()} computes the average spacing of all input points to their $k$ nearest neighbors.
