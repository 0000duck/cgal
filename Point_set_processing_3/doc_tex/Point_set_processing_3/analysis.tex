Function \ccc{CGAL::compute_average_spacing()} computes the average spacing of all input points to their $k$ nearest neighbor points, $k$ being specified by the user. As it provides an order of a point set density, this function is used downstream the surface reconstruction pipeline to automatically determine some parameters such as output mesh sizing.
\ccRefIdfierPage{CGAL::compute_average_spacing}
The following example reads a point set in the \ccc{xyz} format and computes the average spacing

Note that other functions such as centroid or bounding volumes are found in other \cgal \components:
\ccRefIdfierPage{CGAL::centroid}  \\
\ccRefIdfierPage{CGAL::bounding_box}  \\
\ccRefIdfierPage{CGAL::bounding_sphere}  \\
