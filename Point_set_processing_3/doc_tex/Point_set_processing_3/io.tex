\section{Input/Output}


\subsection{Property Maps}

The algorithms of this component take as input parameters iterator ranges of 3D points, or of 3D points with normals. The property maps are used to access the point or normal information from the input data, so as to let the user decide upon the implementation of a point with normal. The latter can be represented as, e.g., a class derived from the \cgal\ 3D point, or as a
\ccc{std::pair<Point_3<K>, Vector_3<K> >}, or as a \ccc{boost::tuple<..,Point_3<K>, ..., Vector_3<K> >}.\\
\\

An another component provides property maps to support these cases:  \\
\ccc{CGAL::Dereference_property_map<T>}  \\
\ccc{CGAL::First_of_pair_property_map<Pair>} and \ccc{CGAL::Second_of_pair_property_map<Pair>}  \\
\ccc{CGAL::Nth_of_tuple_property_map<N, Tuple>}  \\
\\
Note that Dereference_property_map is the default value of the position property map expected by all functions in this component. Users of this component may use other types to represent positions and normals as long as the corresponding property maps are implemented.


\subsection{Streams}

We provide functions to read and write sets of points or sets of points with normals from the following ASCII file formats: XYZ (three point coordinates \ccc{x y z} per line or three point coordinates and three normal vector coordinates \ccc{x y z nx ny nz} per line), and OFF (Object File Format) \cite{cgal:p-gmgv16-96}.

\ccc{CGAL::read_xyz_points}  \\
\ccc{CGAL::read_off_points}  \\
\ccc{CGAL::write_off_points} \\
\ccc{CGAL::write_xyz_points} \\


\subsection{Example}

The following example reads a point set from an input file and writes it to a file, both in the XYZ format. Positions and normals are stored in pairs and accessed through property maps.
