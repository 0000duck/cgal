Point Set Processing

Pierre Alliez, Laurent Saboret, Gael Guennebaud, Mariette Yvinec

This CGAL package implements two state-of-the-art surface reconstruction methods. The input is an unorganized point set, possibly with attributes such as unoriented or oriented normals. Since reconstruction methods often require to preprocess a point set (reduction, smoothing, outlier removal, normal estimation, normal orientation), we provide components devoted to these tasks. The output is either an implicit function (ready for evaluation by any contouring algorithm), or a surface mesh generated by the CGAL surface mesh generator.
