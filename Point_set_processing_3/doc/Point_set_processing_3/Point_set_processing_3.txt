# Introduction # {#Point_set_processing_3Introduction}

This \cgal component implements methods to analyze and process
unorganized 3D point sets. The input is an unorganized 3D point set,
possibly with normal attributes (unoriented or oriented). This point
set can be analyzed to measure geometric properties such as average
spacing between the points and their `k` nearest neighbors. It
can be processed with functions devoted to the simplification, outlier
removal, smoothing, normal estimation and normal orientation. The
processing of point sets is often needed in applications dealing with
measurement data, such as surface reconstruction from laser scanned
data (see Figure \ref Point_set_processing_3figintroduction).

In the context of surface reconstruction we can position the elements
of this component along the common surface reconstruction pipeline
(Figure \ref Point_set_processing_3figpipeline) which involves the
following steps: 1) Scanning and scan alignment to produce a set of
points or points with normals (alignment is not yet covered in \cgal);
2) Outlier removal; 3) Simplification to reduce the number of input
points; 4) Smoothing to reduce noise in the input data; 5) Normal
estimation and orientation when the normals are not already provided
by the acquisition device; and 6) Surface reconstruction. Chapter
\ref Chapter_Surface_Reconstruction_from_Point_Sets "Surface Reconstruction from Point Sets"
deals with surface reconstruction from point sets with normal attributes.

# Input/Output # {#Point_set_processing_3Input}

## Property Maps ##

The algorithms of this component take as input parameters iterator
ranges of 3D points, or of 3D points with normals. The property maps
are used to access the point or normal information from the input
data, so as to let the user decide upon the implementation of a point
with normal. The latter can be represented as, e.g., a class derived
from the \cgal 3D point, or as a `std::pair<Point_3<K>, Vector_3<K>>`, 
or as a `boost::tuple<..,Point_3<K>, ..., Vector_3<K> >`.

The following classes described in Chapter \ref chapterProperty_map
provide property maps for the implementations of points with normals
listed above:

- `CGAL::Dereference_property_map<T>` 
- `CGAL::First_of_pair_property_map<Pair>` and `CGAL::Second_of_pair_property_map<Pair>` 
- `CGAL::Nth_of_tuple_property_map<N, Tuple>` 

`Dereference_property_map<Point_3>` is the default value of the
position property map expected by all functions in this component.

See below examples using pair and tuple property maps.

Users of this package may use other types to represent positions and
normals if they implement the corresponding property maps.

## Streams ##

We provide functions to read and write sets of points or sets of
points with normals from the following ASCII file formats: XYZ (three
point coordinates `x y z` per line or three point coordinates and
three normal vector coordinates `x y z nx ny nz` per line), and OFF
(Object File Format) \cite cgal:p-gmgv16-96.

- `CGAL::read_xyz_points` 
- `CGAL::read_off_points` 
- `CGAL::write_off_points` 
- `CGAL::write_xyz_points` 

## Example ##

The following example reads a point set from an input file and writes
it to a file, both in the XYZ format. Positions and normals are stored
in pairs and accessed through property maps.
\cgalexample{Point_set_processing_3/read_write_xyz_point_set_example.cpp}

# Analysis # {#Point_set_processing_3Analysis}

Function `CGAL::compute_average_spacing()` computes the average
spacing of all input points to their `k` nearest neighbor points,
`k` being specified by the user. As it provides an order of a
point set density, this function is used downstream the surface
reconstruction pipeline to automatically determine some parameters
such as output mesh sizing for surface reconstruction.

## Example ##

The following example reads a point set in the `xyz` format and
computes the average spacing. Index, position and color are stored in
a tuple and accessed through property maps.
\cgalexample{Point_set_processing_3/average_spacing_example.cpp}

Note that other functions such as centroid or bounding volumes are
found in other \cgal components:

- `CGAL::centroid` 
- `CGAL::bounding_box` 
- `Min_sphere_of_spheres_d<Traits>` 



# Outlier Removal # {#Point_set_processing_3Outlier}

Function `CGAL::remove_outliers()` deletes a user-specified fraction
of outliers from an input point set. More specifically, it sorts the
input points in increasing order of average squared distances to their
`k` nearest neighbors and deletes the points with largest value.

## Example ##

The following example reads a point set and removes 5% of the
points. It uses the `CGAL::Dereference_property_map<Point_3>` property
map (optional as it is the default position property map of all
functions in this component.)
\cgalexample{Point_set_processing_3/remove_outliers_example.cpp}

# Simplification # {#Point_set_processing_3Simplification}


Two simplification functions are devised to reduce an input point set,
either randomly or using a grid-based clustering approach.

Function `CGAL::random_simplify_point_set()` randomly deletes a
user-specified fraction of points from the input point set. This
algorithm is fast.

Function `CGAL::grid_simplify_point_set()` considers a regular grid
covering the bounding box of the input point set, and clusters all
points sharing the same cell of the grid by picking as representant
one arbitrarily chosen point. This algorithm is slower than
`CGAL::random_simplify_point_set()`.

## Example ##

The following example reads a point set and simplifies it by clustering.
\cgalexample{Point_set_processing_3/grid_simplification_example.cpp}

# Smoothing # {#Point_set_processing_3Smoothing}


Function `CGAL::jet_smooth_point_set` smooths the input point set by
projecting each point onto a smooth parametric surface patch
(so-called jet surface) fitted over its `k` nearest neighbors.


## Example ##

The following example generates a set of 9 points close to the `xy` 
plane and smooths them using 8 nearest neighbors:
\cgalexample{Point_set_processing_3/jet_smoothing_example.cpp}

# Normal Estimation # {#Point_set_processing_3Normal}

Assuming a point set sampled over an inferred surface \f$ S\f$, two
functions provide an estimate of the normal to \f$ S\f$ at each
point. The result is an unoriented normal vector for each input point.

Function `CGAL::jet_estimate_normals()` estimates the normal direction
at each point from the input set by fitting a jet surface over its `k`
nearest neighbors. The default jet is a quadric surface. This
algorithm is well suited to point sets scattered over curved surfaces.

Function `CGAL::pca_estimate_normals()` estimates the normal direction
at each point from the set by linear least squares fitting of a plane
over its `k` nearest neighbors. This algorithm is simpler and
faster than `CGAL::jet_estimate_normals()`.

# Normal Orientation # {#Point_set_processing_3Normal}

Function `CGAL::mst_orient_normals()` orients the normals of a set of
points with unoriented normals using the method described by Hoppe et
al. in <I>Surface reconstruction from unorganized points</I> \cite cgal:hddms-srup-92. 
More specifically, this method constructs a
Riemannian graph over the input points (the graph of the `k`
nearest neighbor points) and propagates a seed normal orientation
within a minimum spanning tree computed over this graph. The result is
an oriented normal vector for each input unoriented normal, except for
the normals which could not be successfully oriented.

## Example ##

The following example reads a point set from a file, estimates the
normals through PCA over the 6 nearest neighbors and orients the
normals:
