\PkgDesc{This \cgal component implements methods to analyze and process unorganized point sets. The input is an unorganized point set, possibly with normal attributes (unoriented or oriented). The point set can be analyzed to measure its average spacing, and processed through functions devoted to the simplification, outlier removal, smoothing, normal estimation and normal orientation.}

\PkgDescriptionEnd

This \cgal component implements methods to analyze and process
unorganized point sets. The input is an unorganized point set,
possibly with attributes. This point set can be analyzed to measure
average spacing, a global estimation of the point set
density. Furthermore we can process it with functions devoted to
simplification, outlier removal, smoothing, normal estimation and
normal orientation.
