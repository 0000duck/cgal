\section{Union-find}

\cgal\ also provides a class \ccc{Union_find} that implements a partition
of values into disjoint sets.  This is implemented with union by rank and
path compression.  The running time for $m$ set operations on $n$ elements
is $O(n\alpha(m,n))$ where $\alpha(m,n)$ is the extremely slowly growing
inverse of Ackermann's function.
