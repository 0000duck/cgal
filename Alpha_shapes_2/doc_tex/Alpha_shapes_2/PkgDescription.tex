\ccPkgSummary{
This package offers  a data structure encoding the whole family of alpha-complexes
related to a given 2D Delaunay or regular triangulation. In particular, the data structure
allows to retrieve   the alpha-complex for any alpha value, the whole spectrum of critical
alpha values and a filtration on the triangulation faces (this filtration is based on the first 
alpha value for which each face is included on the alpha-complex).}
