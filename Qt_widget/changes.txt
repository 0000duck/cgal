1.3.63 - 20/01/2004 [rursu]
----------------------------------------
	I have added two new layers:
	  Navigation_layer.h, Custom_zoom_layer.h
	I have updated the doc too.

1.3.62 - 21/11/2003
----------------------------------------
	We don't have time for ROTATIONS support, so we roll back the 
	Rotations stuff.
	It remains in v1_3_61 though.

1.3.61 - 19/11/2003
----------------------------------------
	I want the latest changes in the testsuite
    This version of Qt_widget knows how to use rotations.
    This is achieved using Aff_transformation_2 of CGAL.
    x_real, y_real, x_pixel, y_pixel in all kind of versions (templated or not) are deprecated.
    xy_real, xy_pixel version were added.
    added a new rotation layer in the standard toolbar, but is only experimental.
    The only operator that is working well with rotations is the point output operator. The others are not modified. It is more complicated for geometric entities that intersects the boundaaries of the screen. I will do it one by one in time.
    I will update demos as soon as I make it work with all the ouput operators.

	Fixed Nef2 demo. Both layers could be seen.

1.3.2 - 04-12-2002
------------------
	Fix for Qt-2.3

1.3.1 - 26-12-2002
------------------
	Qt_widget_standard_tollbar now derives from QToolBar.
	Qt_widget_standard_tollbar constructor has two extra optional
arguments, to set the dock area (top, bottom, left, right), if a
newline should be inserted, and the name of the toolbar as a QObject.

1.3.0 - 12-11-2002
------------------
	New icons were introduced in the old icon files.
	Their name is: filename_small_xpm.
	The demos use both of them with QIconSet.

1.2.49 -08-11-2002
-------------------
	The qmainwindow.h header file was missing from some demo files. This fix it's only for Windows cause Linux didn't complain.

1.2.48 - 25-10-2002
-------------------
	Removed precision problem in output operator for segments. The intersection between iso_rectangle and the segment is done in simple_cartesian<double>
	Nef_2 complained about that.

1.2.47 - 22-10-2002
-------------------
	The alpha_shape, triangulation, triangulation_constrained resize the widget to fit the bounding box of loaded triangulation

1.2.46
--------
	The Qt_widget_standard_toolbar contains a layer to display mouse real world coordinates.
	The demos no longer use this layer in their toolbar_layer.

1.2.45
-------
	patched Triangulation_2_constrained for Windows
	clear_history() calls now configure_history_buttons()
	
1.2.44
-------
	patched couple files that were not tested under Linux for the previous modifs 1.2.43

1.2.43
--------
	set_window was setting ranges and added to history even when the geometry of the widget wasn't yet known. Now, set_scaled and add_to_history is delayed in showEvent(...)	 
	the << operators for segment, triangle and triangulation were changed.
	the first 2 of them due to very slow bug when segments were degenerated (very big)
	the << operator for triangulation use the apply_to_range function to output only the visible triangles
	removed redraw from the zoom and the history actions in Qt_widget_standard_toolbar.C. Everything was drawn twice.

	

1.2.42
---------
	set_window was setting ranges even when the geometry of the widget
wasn't yet known. Now, set_scaled is delayed in showEvent(...)


1.2.41
---------
	In Qt_widget x_real_rational and y_real_rational were removed. There is only x_real and y_real, specialized for Gmpq. They have no return type now and the result is passed through the second param.
1.2.40
----------
	Qt_widget have 2 new functions x_real_rational and y_real_rational.
	Those 2 return an Gmpq object. The conversion between screen coordinates and real world coordinates return a more simple number (rational), a Gmpq object.
	I put that in the doc either.

1.2.39
----------
	The VC7 vcproj files were added in binary mode for all the demos in Qt_widget. This projects are configured for RELEASE/DEBUG mode with Qt3.0
	Also couple demos have a cgal_types.h file that contain all the CGAL types definitions.

1.2.38
----------
	The alpha shapes demo was modified.
	The nef_2 output operator for Qt_widget was patched.
	The nef_2 has been added in the testsuite.
