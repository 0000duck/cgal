Purpose:
     This package is an example of a CEP.

Description:

      Distributed with this package are the following things:
        README       -- this file
        INSTALLATION -- file describing more details about package installation
        doc/         -- directory containing the package documentation in
                        postscript and HTML format
        cep_test     -- shell script for running the test suite
        include/     -- directory containing the Vanilla header files
        lib/         -- directory that will contain libVanill.a
        makefile     -- used to compile the libVanill.a and install the library
                        and header files
        src/         -- directory containing source code for the Vanilla
                        library
        test_suite/  -- directory containing the test suite source code,
                        input and output files
 
      This package provides a templated class that allows one to create
      different flavors (e.g. vanilla, chocolate, ...) of geometric objects.  
      This is useful, for example, when ... 

Changes:
      1.1    fixed bugs that didn't allow fruity flavors
      1.0    initial release

Installation:
      The command 'make install' may be used to install the Vanilla header 
      files and the library libVanill.a. 

      For further information on the installation process, see the 
      INSTALLATION file in this directory.
      
Documentation:
      Package documentation is provided in postscript and HTML format in
      the subdirectory doc.
      
Tested items:
      The package provides the following functions and algorithms:
          ...

      All functions and constructors have been tested.  

Testing process:
      First, every function and constructor is called in isolation.  Then, the
      "flavor enhancement" algorithm is tested first with a random set of input 
      points that contains degeneracies, and then with a input provided in 
      an input file, for which the output is known. The output of the algorithm
      with the data provided in the input file is compared with the correct
      output provided in an output file.

Hardware & Software requirements:
      The software requires at least 16 Mbytes of memory.  

Constraints:
      The package works with the configuration SunOS-5.6_g++-2.95.1_LEDA
      only after some patches for the library have been installed.
