\begin{ccPkgDescription}{3D Boolean Operations on  Nef Polyhedra}
\ccPkgSummary{
3D Nef polyhedra, are a
boundary representation for cell-complexes bounded by halfspaces that
supports Boolean operations and topological operations in full
generality including unbounded cells, mixed dimensional cells (e.g.,
isolated vertices and antennas). Nef polyhedra distinguish between
open and closed sets and can represent non-manifold geometry.}
