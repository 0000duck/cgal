\ccFunction{std::size_t
OFF_to_nef_3(std::istream& in, Nef_polyhedron_3& N);} {constructs 3D
Nef polyhedron from OFF file. OFF file is read from input stream
\ccc{in}. The purpose of \ccc{OFF_to_nef_3} is to create
a Nef polyhedron from an OFF file that cannot be handled by the
\ccc{Nef_polyhedron_3} constructors. It handles double coordinates
while using a homogenous kernel, non-coplanar facets, surfaces with
boundaries, self-intersecting surfaces, and single facets. Every
closed volume gets marked. The function returns the number of facets
it could not handle.}
