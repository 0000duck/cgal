    implements linear cell complexes, objects in \emph{d}-dimension with
    linear geometry. The combinatorial part of objects is described by
    combinatorial maps, representing all the cells of the object plus
    the incidence and adjacency relations between cells. Geometry is
    added on combinatorial maps simply by associating a \ccc{Point} to each
    vertex of the map.
    
    Taking a 2D combinatorial map, and using 3D points, gives a
    \ccc{Linear_cell_complex} equivalent to a \ccc{Polyhedron_3}.}
