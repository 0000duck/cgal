\ccDefinition
A model for \ccc{Kernel_d} and \ccc{DelaunayTriangulationTraits} that
uses Cartesian coordinates to represent the geometric objects.  The
integer parameter \ccc{dimension} is the dimension of the ambient
Euclidean space. It supports construction of points from \ccc{double}
Cartesian coordinates. It provides exact geometric predicates, but
inexact geometric constructions.

This kernel is default constructible and copyable. It does not carry any state so it is possible to use objects created by one instance with functors created by another one.

Note that this kernel does not completely conform to the \ccc{Kernel_d}
concept: it is missing the constructions \ccc{Lift_to_paraboloid_d} and
\ccc{Project_along_d_axis_d} which do not make sense with a fixed
dimension.
