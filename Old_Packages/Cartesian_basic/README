COMMON COMMANDS:

make test : try to see if you still work. Try not to modify the
  local test-suite. The test makefile has been patched to include also
  the other Cartesian packages. For this to work, you must have
  Cartesian_basic, C2 and C3 in the same directory.

MAKING A RELEASE OF THE PACKAGE:

Try "make package" first. Then "make test". If it works, you might have
a good package. Note: sometimes, the change will only be good if you
submit both C2 *and* Cartesian_basic. Otherwise, you might break the
release.
