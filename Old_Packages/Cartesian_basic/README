RULES FOR CORRECT USE OF THIS PACKAGE

CVS Maintainer: Mariette Yvinec (yvinec@sophia.inria.fr)
CVS Write-access: herve, geert-jan, sylvain, stefan, mariette

IMPORTANT FILES:
* changes.txt: records a succinct description of the changes between
  releases. Put the latest (non submitted) changes at the top under no
  release numbers.
  Please, anytime you add something, modify this file (with your
  name between brackets, see Sylvain's entries).
* include/CGAL/* : the source files. There is no web/ subdirectory.
  Please therefore comment the source code appropriately.
* Makefile : has some nice targets for releasing the packages. You must
  use gmake.
* version: can be changed easily by "make VERSION=3.X.Y version"

COMMON COMMANDS:

cvs update : before starting your work (make sure you have the latest)

{vim,emacs,ed,...} include/CGAL/Cartesian/* : modify the sources

make test : try to see if you still work. Try not to modify the
  local test-suite. The test makefile has been patched to include also
  the other Cartesian packages. For this to work, you must have
  Cartesian_basic, C2 and C3 in the same directory.

cvs commit : commit your changes. Always cvs update before just to make
  sure you'll have no conflict. As for the log file, I usually enter the
  line(s) that I added in changes.txt (it's a good check if you did
  modify that file...)

MAKING A RELEASE OF THE PACKAGE: (please ask herve first, or if he's away)

Try "make package" first. Then "make test". If it works, you might have
a good package. Note: sometimes, the change will only be good if you
submit both C2 *and* Cartesian_basic. Otherwise, you might break the
release.

Then please patch the makefile for your own target (like "make
submit-geert"). Currently "make submit" will only work on the INRIA
machines.

NOTES:
Please add your comments below, if you think something is wrong or misstated.
