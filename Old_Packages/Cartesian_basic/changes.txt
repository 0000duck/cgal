Ver 3.0 (13 July 1999)
****EXTENSIVE CHANGES -- enough to warrant a new 3.0 release*****
- REWROTE FROM SCRATCH (Hervé)
- new <CGAL/Cartesian/...> subdirectory
  predicates_on_ftC2.h put into <CGAL/predicates/kernel_ftC2.h>
  basic_construction_ftC2.h put into <CGAL/constructions/kernel_ftC2.h>
- new scheme by Michael Hoffmann, which assumes partial specialization
- temporary scheme by Stefan Schirra, which does not assume it
- new config flag: CGAL_CFG_NO_ADVANCED_KERNEL to check for Michael's design
  availability vs Stefan's
- Michael' scheme by default, use -DCGAL_CFG_NO_ADVANCED_KERNEL for Stefan's design
  (requires $CGAL/test/NewKernel, which can be found in CGAL-2.1-I-x , x>=12)
  until the flag is added in the release
- Different files for Cartesian_2.h and Cartesian_3.h
  and different kernel traits Cartesian_2 and Cartesian_3

Ver 2.1 (24 May 1999)
- Resubmitted for CGAL 2.0
- Minor additions to the package, no changes in the code.

Ver 2.0 (29 Feb 1999)
- Changed to namespace CGAL

Ver 1.4 (30 Jun 1998)
- CGAL_rft_wrapper<ft> (lines 111/112 of cartesian_rep): FT instead of ft
  (Thanks to Michael Hoffmann)

Ver 1.3 (22 Jun 1998)
- Added Point_d and Conic_2 types in CGAL_Cartesian

Ver 1.2 ( 16 June 1998)
- Inverted FT and Data_accessor declaration in cartesian_rep

NO VERSION 1.1
- Was an old symbolic version, I didn't want to reuse the same
  number.

Ver 1.0 (16 June 1998)
- From Andreas Fabri and Stefan Schirra's original implementation.
- Separated from package C2  (because there was no reason that it
  belongs more to C2 than to C3, and then confusion ensues).
- Changes by Stefan Schirra:
* Compile-time-tags for representation classes added in new
    file representation_tags.h (included in ..._rep.h files)
* classes CGAL_PointCd<FT> and CGAL_PointHd<FT,RT> declared
  in homogeneous_classes.h and cartesian_classes.h .
  Corresponding typedefs added to the rep classes.
