Version 3.3.7 (?? ?? 1999)
- Added missing headers [syl].
- Remove protect macros [syl].

Version 3.3.6 (October 7 1999)
- Removed  CVS conflict in Cartesian (was submitted in 3.3.5)

Version 3.3.5 (October 7 1999)
- Added include iterator_traits_pointer_specs_for_cartesian_kernel.h
  in Cartesian.h

Version 3.3.4 (September 17 1999)
- Corrected template paramter of PointCd

Version 3.3.3 (September 17 1999)
- Added Point_d_base in Cartesian

Version 3.3.2 (September 16 1999)
- Added missing typename in Cartesian_dynamic_d
- Added missing typedefs for RT and FT in Cartesian_dynamic_d
- Added predicate and construction objects in Cartesian_3 (synchronized
  with Homogeneous)

Version 3.3.1 (September 9 1999)
- Removed <CGAL/Kernel/function_objects.h> which bazooked H2 and H3

Version 3.3 (September 3 1999)
- Added Point_d to Cartesian

Version 3.2.4 (September 2 1999)
- Removed references to <CGAL/Kernel/function_objects_?.h>
  and copy pasted directly into Cartesian_? classes,
  because M$VC++ doesn't accept this (legal?) design
- This means <CGAL/Kernel/...> are now not used, but they are kept
  for the future if M$VC++ starts accepting them.
- Added definitions of Cartesian_3::*_2, even though I do not include the
  corresponding <CGAL/Cartesian/*_2.?> (except for Point_2)
  This only works if the compiler does lazy instantiation

Version 3.2.3 (September 2 1999)
- Release for M$VC++ which doesn't understand Base::
  I renamed it to Kernel_base in all the Cartesian* classes

Version 3.2.2 (September 2 1999)
- fixed include files that still included <CGAL/...C2.h>
  [worked with symlinks, but not in releases newer than 2.1-I-13]

Version 3.2.1 (Sept 1 1999)
- Release again for I-15 made in Dagstuhl

Version 3.2 (Sept 1 1999)
- Includes new predicates and construction files in C2 and C3

Version 3.1 (August 31 1999)
- Changes decided in Dagstuhl: addition of Function_objects in the kernel
- Creation of <CGAL/Kernel/{Construction,Predicate}_objects_{2,3}.h>
  these files will be integrated by Stefan into his packages _2 and _3
- Addition of Point_2 in Cartesian_3 (for functionality in Plane_3)

Ver 3.0 (13 July 1999)
****EXTENSIVE CHANGES -- enough to warrant a new 3.0 release*****
- REWROTE FROM SCRATCH (Hervé)
- new <CGAL/Cartesian/...> subdirectory
  predicates_on_ftC2.h put into <CGAL/predicates/kernel_ftC2.h>
  basic_construction_ftC2.h put into <CGAL/constructions/kernel_ftC2.h>
- new scheme by Michael Hoffmann, which assumes partial specialization
- temporary scheme by Stefan Schirra, which does not assume it
- new config flag: CGAL_CFG_NO_ADVANCED_KERNEL to check for Michael's design
  availability vs Stefan's
- Michael' scheme by default, use -DCGAL_CFG_NO_ADVANCED_KERNEL for Stefan's design
  (requires $CGAL/test/NewKernel, which can be found in CGAL-2.1-I-x , x>=12)
  until the flag is added in the release
- Different files for Cartesian_2.h and Cartesian_3.h
  and different kernel traits Cartesian_2 and Cartesian_3

Ver 2.1 (24 May 1999)
- Resubmitted for CGAL 2.0
- Minor additions to the package, no changes in the code.

Ver 2.0 (29 Feb 1999)
- Changed to namespace CGAL

Ver 1.4 (30 Jun 1998)
- CGAL_rft_wrapper<ft> (lines 111/112 of cartesian_rep): FT instead of ft
  (Thanks to Michael Hoffmann)

Ver 1.3 (22 Jun 1998)
- Added Point_d and Conic_2 types in CGAL_Cartesian

Ver 1.2 ( 16 June 1998)
- Inverted FT and Data_accessor declaration in cartesian_rep

NO VERSION 1.1
- Was an old symbolic version, I didn't want to reuse the same
  number.

Ver 1.0 (16 June 1998)
- From Andreas Fabri and Stefan Schirra's original implementation.
- Separated from package C2  (because there was no reason that it
  belongs more to C2 than to C3, and then confusion ensues).
- Changes by Stefan Schirra:
* Compile-time-tags for representation classes added in new
    file representation_tags.h (included in ..._rep.h files)
* classes CGAL_PointCd<FT> and CGAL_PointHd<FT,RT> declared
  in homogeneous_classes.h and cartesian_classes.h .
  Corresponding typedefs added to the rep classes.
