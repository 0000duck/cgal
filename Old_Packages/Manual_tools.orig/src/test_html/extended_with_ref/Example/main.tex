As of release 3.11 of the manual tools, it is possible to create a user manual 
and reference manual with a common table of contents, bibliography and index 
in one document and thus get easy hyperlinking between the two manuals.  
When the manual source files are not split into subdirectories,
this is easily accomplished using the \verb|\part| command of
\LaTeX.  When the manual source files are split into subdirectories
where some file names may be the same and thus it is necessary to use the 
{\tt -extended} switch with {\tt cc\_manual\_to\_html}, the {\tt -ref\_manual} 
switch can be used as well to indicate which of the subdirectories belong
to the reference manual.  Here we show a simple example of such a
conversion.  See the related documention for more details.
