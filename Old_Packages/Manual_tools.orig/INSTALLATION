Installation
============

(1)  The LaTeX style files 'cc_manual.sty', 'cc_manual_index.sty',
     'latex_converter.sty', 'cprog.sty', 'nonlinkedpath.sty', and the 
     subdirectory 'eps_tabs/' in the `format/' directory have to be made 
     accessable for TeX, e.g. copy them into a directory that is included 
     in $TEXINPUTS. (The subdirectory `eps_tabs' must be copied as a directory 
     and not simply its contents.)

(2)  The directory `scripts/' contains two csh-scripts that help with
     the new manual style for C++ reference pages: cc_ref_wizard
     and cc_make_ref_pages. They assume csh to be located at `/bin/csh'.
     They should be made accessible in the standard execution path. An
     example file `cc_ref_wizard_rc' is provided for user configurations
     in `$HOME/.cc_ref_wizard_rc'.

(3)  The directory `scripts/' contains two Perl scripts that help in the 
     creation of the index for the PostScript version of the manual: 
     add_part_num and index_fix.  These scripts may need to be edited to 
     reflect the proper locations of the Perl intepreter.

(4)  The manuals exist already formatted in the `doc/' directory as
     PostScript files. If reformatting is necessary, use `bibtex <manual>'
     and `makeindex <manual>' besides LaTeX to complete the manuals.

(5)  The directory `src/' contains the supporting tools. Continue with
     src/INSTALLATION to finish the installation.
