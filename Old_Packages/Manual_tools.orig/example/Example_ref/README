The files in this directory, except intro.tex and main.tex, were created
using cc_ref_wizard in this directory.  In particular:

    cc_ref_wizard -p Example Concept               Circulator
    cc_ref_wizard -p Example Class                 Circulator_traits
    cc_ref_wizard -p Example Enum                  Orientation
    cc_ref_wizard -p Example Function              is_empty_range
    cc_ref_wizard -p Example FunctionObjectConcept Kernel::Less_xy_2
    cc_ref_wizard -p Example FunctionObjectClass   Less_xy_2
    cc_ref_wizard -p Example Constant              ORIGIN
    cc_ref_wizard -p Example Macro                 For_all

For the Circulator concept, ccRefPageBegin and ccRefPageEnd commands
were redefined so the concept would be marked as advanced.  A template 
parameter <C> has been added later on to the class Circulator_traits. 
Also, page breaks were added to show the page headings that appear for 
concepts and classes.  The enum example Orientation has been edited to
include two meaningful tags and the necessary declarations to get them
hyperlinked.  The other reference pages have not been edited.

The configuration file $HOME/.cc_ref_wizard_rc (or the environment)
contained the following two variable settings while creating the
reference pages.

    set  REF_WIZARD_AUTHOR = "Lutz Kettner"
    set  REF_WIZARD_SUBDIR = "DIR"

The Example_ref/main.tex file has been created with cc_make_ref_pages
in the directory containing Example_ref/:

    cc_make_ref_pages Example_ref
