Halfedge_DS Package: Release changes:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

     - Halfedge_data_structure_using_vector.h: Fixed bug in updating
       face pointers in the border case. Bug reported by Steve M. Robbins.
     - Fixed warnings in the test suite about unused variables.

2.9 (01 Jun 2001)

     - Halfedge_data_structure_using_vector.h: Fixed missing & in 
       update_prev(). Bug reported by Xiangmin Jiao.
     - Halfedge_data_structure_using_list.h: Fixed bug in copy  
       constructor and assignment operator to copy pairs instead of 
       single halfedges. Bug reported by Xiangmin Jiao.

2.8 (13 Sep 2000)

     Vertex, Halfedge, and Facet class prefixed with HDS in the doc.

2.7 (25 Nov 1999)

     More changes in Halfedge_data_structure_using_vector to reflect that
     the std::vector::iterator is not necessarily a pointer.

2.6 (19 Nov 1999)

     More changes in Halfedge_data_structure_using_vector to reflect that
     the std::vector::iterator is not necessarily a pointer.

2.5 (18 Nov 1999)

     CGAL_DEFINE_ITERATOR_TRAITS_POINTER_SPEC added to the test files
     where necessary. hds_test split into five tests to see MSVC failures
     better. Class Halfedge_data_structure_using_vector changed to cope
     better with std::vector::iterator that are not plain pointers. But
     they are still be assumed to be constructable from a pointer.

2.4 (22 May 1999)

     Typos before CGAL R2.0 fixed.

2.3 (29 Apr 1999)

     Long name flags added in makefiles.

2.2 (07 Apr 1999)

     std:: namespace added for vector in Halfedge_data_structure_decorator.h
     and Halfedge_data_structure_using_vector.h. Warning removed from
     hds_prog_compact2.C.

2.1 (09 Mar 1999)

     Standard headers, std namespace and CGAL namespace. Bug fix in
     erase_facet. Minor cleanups. join_loop and join_facet accept holes.

1.10 (19 Jan 1999)

     Documentation fixes.

1.9 (02 Dec 1998)

     Corrected and changed implementation for erase_connected_component
     in Halfedge_data_structure_decorator.h.

1.8 (08 Oct 1998)

     Two warnings in the "*_compact*" examples fixed.

1.7 (10 Jul 1998)

     New methods: erase_facet, and erase_connected_component.
     Bug in join_vertex with respect to boundary edges fixed.

1.6 (03 Jun 1998)

     A few changes in the doc. Chapter entry in header.

1.5 (09 Apr 1998)

     Spell checker.

1.4 (19 Mar 1998)

     Memory allocation bug fixed.

1.3 (05 Mar 1998)

     Shorter names for internal classes, programs and idraw files
     included for TeX manual. Small change in doc.

1.2 (25 Feb 1998)

     Small changes in the documentation. Two more examples.

1.1 (23 Feb 1998)

     The first release of this package is based on the Polyhedron traits
     classes from the Polyhedron package 1.4 (10 Feb 1998).

     There is still this relocation und linking error with Gnu
     (g++ 2.8.0 as well as egcs g++ 2.90). I have located the error
     in test_hds.C in line 90 as the operator== of the
     CGAL_N_step_adaptor class, which is defined in 94 of
     CGAL/N_step_adaptor.h. I have still no idea what this error
     means and how to avoid it. In line 136 of test_hds.C the same
     operator (on a slightly different data structure) causes
     no error.

None of this package was available in CGAL 0.9.
