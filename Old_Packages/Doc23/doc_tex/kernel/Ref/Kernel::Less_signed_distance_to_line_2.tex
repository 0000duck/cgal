\begin{ccRefFunctionObjectConcept}{Kernel::Less_signed_distance_to_line_2}
A model for this must provide:

\ccCreationVariable{fo}

\ccConstructor{Kernel::Less_signed_distance_to_line_2(const Kernel::Point_2&p, 
                                      const Kernel::Point_2&q);}
{}
 
\ccMemberFunction{bool operator()(const Kernel::Point_2&r,
                                  const Kernel::Point_2&s);}
{returns true iff the distance of $r$ to the oriented line 
through $p$ and $q$, where $p$ and $q$ are the points passed
to the object at construction, is smaller than the distance of
$s$ to this line. If both have the same distance, true is
returned iff the distance of $q$ to $p$ is
smaller than the distance of $r$ to $p$, where $p$ is the point
passed to the object at construction.}
