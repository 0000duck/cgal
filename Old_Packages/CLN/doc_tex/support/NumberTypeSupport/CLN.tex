\section{Number Types Provided by {\sc Cln}}
\label{CLN}

% \ccChapterAuthor{Sylvain Pion}

\cgal\ defines the functions needed to use the number types provided by
{\sc Cln}, the Class Library for Numbers~\cite{cln}.
To use {\sc Cln} with \cgal, just install \cgal\ with {\sc Cln} support,
and include the corresponding {\sc Cln} file but with the prefix
\ccc{CGAL/CLN/}.

\ccInclude{CGAL/CLN/cl_integer.h}

The class \ccc{cl_I}~: exact multiprecision integers.

\ccInclude{CGAL/CLN/cl_rational.h}

The class \ccc{cl_RA}~: exact multiprecision rationals.

And similarly for the 10 ordinary number type classes provided by {\sc Cln}~:
\ccc{cl_SF, cl_FF, cl_DF, cl_LF, cl_I, cl_RA, cl_F, cl_R, cl_N, cl_number}.

For doing IOs, you need to include, for example~:

\ccInclude{cl_integer_io.h}

See the {\sc Cln} documentation for additionnal details.
