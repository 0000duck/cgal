General remarks to forward to Bruno Haible:
-------------------------------------------
- cl_I should probably have a constructor for doubles (at least when they
  effectively store an integer value), like GMP'mpz do (?).  The rationals
  at least should have this exact conversion (they have it, don't they ?).
- Conversions from CLN types to doubles (cl_double_approx) should have a
  guarantee on the precision => separate error bound, or interval.
- Having an interval type would be great...
- Macro names should be prefixed by CLN_.
- Use a namespace CLN ?
- WANT_OBFUSCATING_OPERATORS should be enabled by default, imho, but eh...
- Problems at beginning of CLN compile time on mips.

TODO:
----
- Things that are supported by Gmpz, and should (?) be ported to cl_I:
  - exact_division  (exquo())
  - approximate_decimal_length
  - convert_to<IA>
- Make benchmarks.
- Add the converter functions.
