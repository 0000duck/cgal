TODO:
----
- Use a common include files, with a macro specifying the type ?
  Maybe too dirty to live...
- Add min/max wrappers depending on what is decided for CGAL.
- Should I provide operator/(cl_I, cl_I) ?  Not sure.
- Is it possible to factorize more code (to_double()...) ?
- Things that are supported by Gmpz, and should (?) be ported to cl_I:
  - exact_division  (exquo())
  - approximate_decimal_length
  - convert_to<IA>
- Make benchmarks.
- The test suite needs to be more exhaustive...
  How about a generic NT test-suite ?
- Aller voir les snapshots sur le site FTP...  Attendre la prochaine version
  et s'adapter (il y a min/max/abs, les include *io.h, etc...).
- There's a CygWin version.
