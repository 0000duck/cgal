Changes done to the CLN package.

Version 1.4 on 7 October 1999.
- Doc updates about installation, and IOs.
- The tests don't fail anymore when CLN is not installed.
  (it's easier to spot the "n" in the test suite if it's not a false alarm)

Version 1.3 on 19 August 1999.
- Added src/CLN.C that initializes the printing base to "10".
  It's done by default, but a bug somewhere prevents this on Solaris...
- Added specialization of operator>>(Quotient<cl_I>).
- Test directory, with a simple test_io.C program.

Version 1.2 on 7 July 1999.
- include files moved to the subdirectory include/CGAL/CLN/.
- removed "#include <cl_io.h>" in each of them.
- made a simple example in examples/CLN/example_cln.C.
- patched install_cgal so that CGAL_USE_CLN is set accordingly,
  as well as the correct flags.

Version 1.1 on 26 June 1999.
- Rewrote the doc.
- Submitted the package to internal releases.

Version 1.0 on 26 March 1999.
- initial version.
