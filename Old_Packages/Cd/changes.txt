- Added test suite to the package

Ver 1.1 (Dec 7 1999)
- Added all kernel classes, constructions/predicates and operators
  in include/CGAL/Cartesian
- Rudimentary test suite, copied from 3D kernel, mostly to see
  if it compiles, and to check basic functionality
- wrapper and kernel classes to be found in test/KernelCd/include
- should not change anything to current release,  as long as
  wrapper classes are not moved from test/KernelCd/include to include

Ver 1.0 (Oct 1 1999)
- extracted for (int i=...) declarations into "int i; for (i=...)"
  due to problems with VC++
- added "os << d" in ASCII case of "os << Point_d" 

New package (code from Bernd and Sven, via Stefan)
- contains only PointCd.h
