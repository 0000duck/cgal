Version 3.2.7 (September 2 1999)
- removed #warning which is not standard-compliant and crashes on M$VC++

Version 3.2.6 (September 2 1999)
- Changed all the typename R::FT into typename ClassC2<>::FT
  for M$VC++

Version 3.2.5 (September 2 1999)
- corrected a few buggy FT in Aff_transformation_2<R>::member(FT)
  should have been typenamed R::FT

Version 3.2.4 (September 2 1999)
- corrected buggy typename R::LineC2<R..>::Point_2 in Line_2.C
  (should have been typename LineC2<R..>::Point_2)

Version 3.2.3 (September 2 1999)
- added needed typename in all <CGAL/Cartesian/*.C>
  indeed, Class_2<R>::Subclass needs a typename qualifier for MIPSPRO 7.3
  although it worked with the other compilers

Version 3.2.2 (September 2 1999)
- fixed include files that still included <CGAL/...C2.h>
  [worked with symlinks, but not in releases newer than 2.1-I-13]

Version 3.2.1 (September 1 1999)
- f*ck CVS!

Version 3.2 (September 1 1999)
- moved some constructions and predicates from classes to kernel_ftC2.h
  TODO: finish it so that C2 is robust with filtered
        constructions and predicates
- fixed includes in Cartesian/*_2.h and Cartesian/*_2.C
  TODO: extensive fix of includes, so that it works
        even if you only include one single file (e.g. Point_2.h)

Version 3.1 (August 31, 1999)
- Added Identity into Aff_transformation

Version 3.0 (August 26 1999)
****EXTENSIVE CHANGES -- enough to warrant a new 3.0 release***** 
- new <CGAL/Cartesian/...> subdirectory
  predicates_on_ftC2.h put into <CGAL/predicates/kernel_ftC2.h>
  basic_construction_ftC2.h put into <CGAL/constructions/kernel_ftC2.h>
- new scheme by Michael Hoffmann, which assumes partial specialization
- temporary scheme by Stefan Schirra, which does not assume it
- Michael' scheme by default, use -DCGAL_CFG_NO_ADVANCED_KERNEL for Stefan's design
  (requires $CGAL/test/NewKernel, which can be found in CGAL-2.1-I-x , x>=12)
- each file Class_2.h is not separated into Class_2.h (interface declaration)
  and Class_2.C (method definitions) for easier inclusion of all *.h before *.C
- each file Class_2.h can now be included independently of the others and of the
  representation class (as long as the template parameter R defines the other
  classes in the kernel)
****IMPORTANT: please note
- for now, while we still have two versions, two scripts (create_symlinks and
  remove_symlinks) are included which have to be run before the test suite.
  when using Michael's design. (Nothing to be done for Stefan's design!)
  This is to prevent inclusion of the wrong files *C2.h and *_2.h
  (now we want to include <CGAL/Cartesian/*_2.h> instead of *C2.h)
****BUGS FIXES: in addition, since 2.1.6
- gcc 2.95 compliant (hopefully conform to the standard)
- added std:: for endl (suggestion by Stefan Schirra)
- CGAL::sign corrected everywhere

Version 2.1.7 (June 22 1999)
- Optimized compare_xC2() and side_of_oriented_circleC2().  (syl)
- New intermediate function circumcenter_translateC2() used by
  circumcenterC2() and squared_circumradiusC2().  (syl)
- Renamed the targets of the main Makefile.

Version 2.1.6 (June 22 1999)
- Added missing std:: (sylvain)

Version 2.1.5 (June 11 1999)
- read statement in CircleC2 was wrong (fixed)

Ver 2.1.4 (May 24 1999)
- Added CGAL::sign in DirectionC2
- Minor fixes in inline policy
- Added CGAL:: prefix to to_double() in all files

Ver 2.1.3 (Apr 27 1999)
- Forgot to make the code from the funnelweb!

Ver 2.1.2 (Apr 27 1999)
- added CGAL::compare (Sylvain Pion)
- one typo in predicates la1 instead of l1a (Sylvain Pion)

Ver 2.1.1 (Mar 30 1999)
- Moved #includes out of namespace CGAL

Ver 2.1 (Mar 12 1999)
- Optimized a lot of the expressions in Aff_transformationC2, TriangleC2, etc.
- Added #include <CGAL/Twotuple.h> in some files [Thanks Geert-Jan]

Ver 2.0 (Feb 29 1999)
- Use CGAL_square() where possible.
- Optimized a little bit more CGAL_circumcenterC2(), CGAL_mid_point() and
  CGAL_side_of_oriented_circleC2().
- Changed to namespace CGAL

Ver 1.7 (4 Jan 1999)
- Revised inline policy in basic constructions and predicates
- Added const qualifier to all local variables that qualify for it
  (greatly enhances optimization)
- Optimized the 2D predicates' arithmetic expressions

Ver 1.6 (3 Dec 1998)
- Removed CGAL_square_distance from CircleC2.h
- Relooked the predicates and constructions

Ver 1.5 (30 Nov 1998)
- Added CGAL_compare_deltax_deltay into predicates_on_ftC2.h
- removed warnings for CGAL_Sign( a*b ) (was automatic conversion from
  enum to int)

Ver 1.4 (12 Nov 1998)
- Better separation between C2 and FT, for predicates and constructions
  also.
- Addition of filtered predicates (Include statement, actual predicates in
  another package).
- Local optimizations of predicates (Sylvain Pion)

Ver 1.3 (16 June 1998)
- Made changes suggested by Stefan Schirra:
  * classes CGAL_PointCd<FT> and CGAL_PointHd<FT,RT> declared in
  homogeneous_classes.h and cartesian_classes.h .
  Corresponding typedefs added to the rep classes.
  * Compile-time-tags for representation classes added in new
  file representation_tags.h (included in ..._rep.h files)
  * Rep_tags added to CGAL_Homogeneous and CGAL_Cartesian
- Cartesian part separated into a package Cartesian_basic
  (for ease of maintenance)
- Major face lift to predicates file, with separation between
  predicate_on_ftC2 and other predicate files, that simply call
  the predicate on ft.

Ver 1.2 
- corrected bug in output of Iso_rectangleC2
- CGAL_NULL_TMPL_ARGS added in friend operator declarations

Ver 1.1
- New access functions have been added to Aff_transformation. (Thanks to
  Stefan.)
- New inline policy is now used: There are several levels of
  inlining to be defined in kernel_basic.h.

Ver 1.0
- From the kernel design group
