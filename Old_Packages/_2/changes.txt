- Now CGAL_are_ordered_along_line(p,q,r) have strict
  versions as well. The strict versions return false,
  if the test point is equal to one of the end points
  (the previous H-version behavior) while the fcts 
  without the strictly in the name allow for equality
  (the old C-version behavior).
- Aff_transformations got access mfcts.
- CGAL_compare_delta... added
- added typedefs and typename keyword in _2 classes
