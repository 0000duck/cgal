Version history:
----------------
2.3 (11 Oct 1999)
  - Put the package on the CVS server [Sylvain], and removed a few useless
    files in the process (.ps.gz, *ii), as well as the empty src/ directory.
  - Added a main Makefile to handle submitting, as well as "wrapper.tex" and
    "Makefile" in doc_tex/basic/Boolean_Operations/.
  
2.2
  - New makefile in test/Bopstest
  - in the same directory, in Bops_types.h, removed using declaration of sqrt.

2.1.9 
  - Used a qualified typedef Sement_2 in bops_simple_polygons_2.C (twice).
  - qualified Object with CGAL:: in bops_Convex_Polygon_2.C
  - new makefile in test/Bopstest

2.1.8 (13 Aug 1999) fixed makefile in examples/*/
2.1.7 (10 Aug 1999)
  - fixed syntax in test/Bopstest/cgal_test; changed prefixes .o to
    $(OBJ_EXT) in test/*/ and demo/*/

2.1.6 (3 June 1999)
  - added std:: prefixes before list in bops_Convex_Polygon_2.C (2)
    and bops_simple_polygons_2.C.

2.1.5 (2 June 1999)
  - Added CGAL:: before to_double in min_sqr_distance_traits.h.
    This avoids an infinite loop.

2.1.4 (31 May 1999)
  - Added CGAL:: prefix before assign in example file.
  - Renamed some identifiers in test files (dropping _2 suffix) to avoid
    problems with g++-2.8 which does not have namespaces.
  - Added a few std:: prefixes for IO oprations.

2.1.2 (28 May 1999)
  - Added std:: prefixes in several places.
  - Replaced deriving from std:: by deriving from CGAL_STD:: prefixed names.
  - Renamed some typedefs in the example programs. (Dropping _2 suffix).

2.1 (21 May 1999)
  - ported the examples to namespaces too.
  - investigated the remaining bugs in the compilation, which are to be fixed
    in the kernel.
    (by Geert-Jan Giezeman).

2.0 (30 April 1999)
   - ported to namespaces (by Bernd Gaertner and Sven Schoenherr)

1.1.2 (09 Dec. 1998)
  - bugfix of
      argument list for class template "CGAL_Bops_Convex_Polygons_2" is missing
      in "CGAL/bops_Convex_Polygon_2.h", line 166

1.1.1 (25 Nov. 1998)
  - wrong function name corrected

1.1.0 (21 Oct. 1998)
  - some bugs removed

1.0.9 (30 September 1998)
  - two bugs in convex intersection removed
  - debug infos switched off

1.0.8  (07 August 1998)

1.0.7   (08 July 1998)
  - correct some bugs in the convex case 
 
1.0.6   (07 July 1998) 
  - convex union implemented
                             
1.0.5   (30 June 1998)
  - convex intersection implemented
  - now it should compile and run on sparc_SunOS-5.5_CC-4.2 also.

1.0.4   (30 June 1998)
  - correction of  CGAL_CFG_INCOMPLETE_TYPE_BUG_5 on sparc_SunOS-5.5_CC-4.2
    in file "CGAL/bops_dcel_defs.h"

1.0.3   (12 May 1998)
  - correction of include files in  "CGAL/nsquare_intersecting.h"

1.0.2    (09 Apr 1998)
  - remove another bug in "CGAL/bops_dcel.C"

1.0.1    (07 Apr 1998)
  - remove bug on SUNPRO compiler in "CGAL/bops_dcel.C"
    ( CGAL_CFG_NO_SCOPE_MEMBER_FUNCTION_PARAMETERS)

1.0.0    (31 Mar 1998)
  - to long lines (more than 80 chars) removed

0.9.30c  (11 Mar 1998)
  - set CGAL_CFG_INCOMPLETE_TYPE_BUG_4 in "CGAL/bops_dcel_defs.h" correctly 

0.9.30b  (10 Mar 1998)
