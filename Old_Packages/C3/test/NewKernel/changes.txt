2.3  -> 2.4   (24 Aug 99)
- _3<R> is now derived from R::_3_base instead of R::_3
  typedef typename R::_3            R_3;      replaced by
  typedef typename R::_3_base  R_3;

2.2  -> 2.3   (04 Aug 99)
- updates/workarounds for gcc-2.95:
  s/friend inline/friend CGAL_FRIEND_INLINE
  s/friend CGAL_KERNEL_INLINE/friend CGAL_KERNEL_FRIEND_INLINE
  made all operator-() friends non-friends
  reorganized Point_3 and Vector_3
  added files point_vector_declarations_3.h
              point_vector_definitions_3.C
  added conversion fucntions between points and vectors
  those are friends and used by operator-() - functions that are no friends
    any longer

2.1.2-> 2.2   (22 Jun 99)
- 'inline' placement fixed in Point_3.h and Vector_3.h

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%   R e l e a s e  2 . 0   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

2.1.1-> 2.1.2 (21 May 99)
- packaging script extended ;)

2.1  -> 2.1.1 (21 May 99)
- Less_xyz defined in a new file <predicate_classes_3.h>
  used for fixing a bug in TetrahedraH3==

2.0.3-> 2.1   (16 Apr 99)
- (user reported) bug in operator<<(ostream &os, const Bbox_3& b) fixed:
  return os << b.xmin() << ' ' << b.ymin() << ' ' << b.zmin();
  -->                                      ^^^^^^
- iostream parts prefixed by std::
 
2.0.2-> 2.0.3 (14 Mar 99)
- std::min/max used in <Bbox_3.h>

2.0.1-> 2.0.2 (24 Feb 99)
- CGAL_[BEGIN|END]_NAMESPACE used

2.0  -> 2.0.1 (11 Feb 99)
- Quotient declared in <Vector_3.h>

1.4  -> 2.0
- namespace CGAL { } introduced

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%   R e l e a s e  1 . 2   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

1.3.1-> 1.4
- Use of CGAL...INLINE made consistent between declarations and
  definitions (otherwise SunPro CC 4.2 does not like it).

1.3  -> 1.3.1 (03 Sep 98)
- ORIGIN [!=]= Point_3 added

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%   R e l e a s e  1 . 1   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

1.2.2-> 1.3
- basic_constructions_3.h added
- side_of...sphere revised

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%   R e l e a s e  1 . 0   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

1.2.1-> 1.2.2
- Plane_3::projection(Point_3) added

1.2  -> 1.2.1
- Vector_3 / Quotient added

1.1  -> 1.2
- made fit for egcs

1.0  -> 1.1
- added typename keyword

0.9  -> 1.0
- New access functions have been added to Aff_transformation. 
- typename keyword has been added in most places
