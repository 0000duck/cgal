3.15 (17 Mar 2001)
- Added constructor Vector(Point, Point). 

3.14 (19 Feb 2001)
- Comment out CGAL::Less_xyz<>.

3.13 (14 Feb 2001)

- added min_coord(), max_coord() for Iso_cuboid_3 and new constructor

3.12 (13 Feb 2001)

- added squared_area() function for Triangle_3 and volume() function
  for Tetrahedron_3 and Iso_cuboid_3
- Remove old style casts.
- Simple_homogeneous.

3.11 (24 Jan 2001)

- rearranged some include directives to put them at the top of the file
  removed others that were unnecessary and added some that were missing

3.10  (22 Jan 2001)
- Adapts to new simple cartesian kernel.
- Remove redundant protect macros tests.
- Added a few missing CGAL_ to the NO_?STREAM* macros.

3.9   (15 Oct 2000)

3.8   (08 Oct 2000)

- packaging script fixed
  Sphere_3.h now added

- cross_product added again (see 3.6); package H3 modified instead 

3.6   (11 Aug 2000)

  problem with H3); The base class function should match instead.

- _R -> R_
- Bbox_3 uses Handle_for<> now

3.1   (06 Apr 2000)

  which define class U_3<R, Old_style_tag> : public R::U_3_base

3.0   (02 Feb 2000)

- automatic inclusion for Simple_cartesian added

2.9   (01 Feb 2000)

  in comment; is apparently not necessary anymore

- added to_vector() to Direction_3<R>

2.7.1-> 2.7.2 (08 Oct 99)
- Direction_3<R>::vector() now calls to_vector() on implementation
  classes

  typedef typename R::_3            R_3;      replaced by
  typedef typename R::_3_base  R_3;

2.2  -> 2.3   (04 Aug 99)
- updates/workarounds for gcc-2.95:

  s/friend CGAL_KERNEL_INLINE/friend CGAL_KERNEL_FRIEND_INLINE
  made all operator-() friends non-friends
  reorganized Point_3 and Vector_3
  added files point_vector_declarations_3.h
              point_vector_definitions_3.C
  added conversion fucntions between points and vectors
  those are friends and used by operator-() - functions that are no friends
    any longer

2.1.2-> 2.2   (22 Jun 99)
- 'inline' placement fixed in Point_3.h and Vector_3.h

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%   R e l e a s e  2 . 0   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%   R e l e a s e  1 . 2   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

1.3.1-> 1.4
