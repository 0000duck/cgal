\ccPkgSummary{This chapter describes the functions provided in CGAL
for producing convex hulls in two dimensions as well as functions for
checking if sets of points are strongly convex are not. There are also
a number of functions described for computing particular extreme
points and subsequences of hull points, such as the lower and upper
hull of a set of points.}
