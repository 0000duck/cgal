\section{Traits Classes}

Each of the functions used to compute convex hulls or extreme points
is parameterized by a traits class, which specifies the types and geometric
primitives to be used in the computation.  There are several implementations 
of 2D traits classes provided in the library.  The class
\ccc{Convex_hull_traits_2<R>}\ccIndexMainItem[C]{Convex_hull_traits_2}
corresponds to the default traits class that provides the types and 
predicates presented in the 2-dimensional \cgal\ kernel in which the input 
points lie.  The class 
\ccc{Convex_hull_constructive_traits<R>}\ccIndexMainItem[C]{Convex_hull_constructive_traits}
is a second traits class based on \cgal\ primitives but differs from
\ccc{Convex_hull_traits_2} in that some of its primitives reuse
intermediate results to speed up computation.

In addition, the 2D and 3D Linear Geometric Kernel provides three projective traits classes 
(\ccc{Projection_traits_xy_3<K>}, 
\ccc{Projection_traits_zx_3<K}, and 
\ccc{Projection_traits_yz_3<K}),

which may be used to compute the convex hull of a set of three-dimensional
points projected into each of the three coordinate planes.
