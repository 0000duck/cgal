\ccDefinition

The function \ccRefName\ simplifies in-place a triangulated surface mesh by iteratively collapsing edges.

\ccInclude{CGAL/Surface_mesh_simplification/edge_collapse.h}

\ccFunction
{
template<class EdgeCollapsableMesh,class StopPredicate, class P, class T, class R>
int edge_collapse ( EdgeCollapsableMesh&           surface
                  , StopPredicate           const& should_stop
                  , sms_named_params<P,T,R> const& named_parameters

{Simplifies \ccc{surface} in-place by collapsing edges, and returns
the number of edges effectively removed.
}


\ccHeading{Non-named parameters}

\ccc{surface} defines the type of the surface. 
It must be a model of the \ccc{EdgeCollapsableMesh} concept.

\ccc{should_stop} defines the type of the stop-condition policy.
It must be a model of the \ccc{StopPredicate} concept.

\ccHeading{Named parameters}

\ccc{named_parameters} holds the list of all the additional parameters 
used by the \ccc{edge_collapse} function (including default parameters).

The named parameters list is a composition of function calls, whose names corresponds
to the name of the parameter, separated by a dot ($.$), as in:

\ccc{param0_name(actual_param0).param1_name(actual_param1)}

each named parameter function corresponds to one named parameter.

All named parameters have default values and the order of the named parameters 
is irrelevant so you only need to compose those for which the default
is inappropriate.

\subsubsection*{vertex\_index\_map(VertexIndexMap vpm)}

Maps each vertex in the surface into an unsigned integer number
in the range \ccc{[0,num_vertices(surface))}.

\ccc{VertexIndexMap} must be a
\ccAnchor{http://www.boost.org/libs/property_map/ReadablePropertyMap.html}{ReadablePropertyMap} 
whose \ccc{key_type} is
\ccc{boost::graph_traits<EdgeCollapsableMesh const>::vertex_descriptor}
and whose \ccc{value_type} is 
\ccc{boost::graph_traits<EdgeCollapsableMesh>::size_type},

\textbf{Default}: the property map obtained by calling \ccc{get(vertex_index,surface)},
which requires the surface vertices to have an \ccc{id()} member properly initialized to the 
required value.\\
If the verices don't have such id(), you must pass a map explicitely, such as
the property map obtained by calling \ccc{get(vertex_external_index,surface)},
which constructs an internal map which non-intrusively associates a proper id with each vertex.

\subsubsection*{edge\_index\_map(EdgeIndexMap eim)} 

Maps each {\em directed} edge in the surface into an unsigned integer number
in the range \ccc{[0,num_edges(surface))}.

\ccc{EdgeIndexMap} must be a
\ccAnchor{http://www.boost.org/libs/property_map/ReadablePropertyMap.html}{ReadablePropertyMap} 
whose \ccc{key_type} is
\ccc{boost::graph_traits<EdgeCollapsableMesh const>::edge_descriptor}
and whose \ccc{value_type} is 
\ccc{boost::graph_traits<EdgeCollapsableMesh>::size_type}

\textbf{Default}: the property map obtained by calling \ccc{get(edge_index,surface)},
which requires the surface edges to have an \ccc{id()} member properly initialized to the 
require value.\\
If the edges don't have such id(), you must pass a map explicitely, such as
the property map obtained by calling \ccc{get(edge_external_index,surface)},
which constructs an internal map which non-intrusively associates a proper id with each edge.

\subsubsection*{edge\_is\_border\_map(EdgeIsBorderMap ebm)} 

Maps each {\em directed} edge in the surface into a Boolean value
which indicates if the edge belongs to the boundary of the surface
(facing the outside).
\ccc{EdgeIsBorderMap} must be a 
\ccAnchor{http://www.boost.org/libs/property_map/ReadablePropertyMap.html}{ReadablePropertyMap} 
whose \ccc{key_type} is
\ccc{boost::graph_traits<EdgeCollapsableMesh const>::edge_descriptor}
and whose \ccc{value_type} is \ccc{bool}.

\textbf{Default}: the property map obtained by calling \ccc{get(edge_is_border,surface)}.

\subsubsection*{get\_cost(GetCost gc)}

The policy which returns the collapse cost for an edge.\\
The type of \ccc{gc} must be a model of the \ccc{GetCost} concept.

\textbf{Default}: 
\ccc{CGAL::Surface_mesh_simplification::LindstromTurk_cost<EdgeCollapsableMesh>}.

\subsubsection*{get\_placement(GetPlacement gp)}

The policy which returns the placement (position of the replacemet vertex)
for an edge.\\
The type of \ccc{gp} must be a model of the \ccc{GetPlacement} concept.

\textbf{Default}: 
\ccc{CGAL::Surface_mesh_simplification::LindstromTurk_placement<EdgeCollapsableMesh>}

\subsubsection*{visitor(EdgeCollapseSimplificationVisitor const* v)}

The visitor that is called by the \ccc{edge_collapse} function
in certain points to allow the user to track the simplification process.\\
The type of object pointed to by \ccc{v} must be a model of the \ccc{EdgeCollapseSimplificationVisitor} concept.

\textbf{Default}: \ccc{NULL}.

All these functions naming parameters are defined in
\ccc{namespace CGAL}. Being non-member functions, they could clash
with equally named functions in some other namespace. If that happens
simply qualify the named parameter with \ccc{CGAL::} as shown in the
examples in the user manual.

\ccHeading{Semantics}

The simplification process continues until the \ccc{should_stop} policy returns \ccc{true}
or the surface cannot be simplified any further due to topological constraints.

\ccc{get_cost} and \ccc{get_placement} are the policies which control
the {\em cost-strategy}, that is, the order in which edges are collapsed 
and the remaining vertex is re-positioned.

\ccc{visitor} is an optional object (can be null) which can be used
to keep track of the simplification process.
