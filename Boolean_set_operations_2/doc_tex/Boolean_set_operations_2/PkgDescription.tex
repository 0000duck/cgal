\ccPkgSummary{
This package consists of the implementation of Boolean set-operations
on point sets bounded by weekly x-monotone curves in 2-dimensional
Euclidean space. In
particular, it contains the implementation of regularized Boolean
set-operations, intersection predicates, and point containment predicates.}
