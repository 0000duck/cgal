\cgalConcept

The concept `TriangulationDSVertex` describes what a vertex is in a model of the concept
`TriangulationDataStructure`. It sets requirements of combinatorial nature
only, as geometry is not concerned here. In particular, we only require that
the vertex holds a handle to a full cell incident to it in the triangulation.

These operators can be used directly and are called by the I/O
operator of class `TriangulationDataStructure`.
