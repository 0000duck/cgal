\begin{ccPkgDescription}{Pure Complexes\label{Pkg:PureComplexes}}

\ccPkgSummary{The package \ccc{Pure_complex} provides classes for manipulating
pure complexes (often called triangulations) in euclidean spaces whose
dimension can be specified at compile-time or at run-time. Specifically, it
provides a combinatorial Pure complex data structure, which is extended into
geometric pure complex and Delaunay complex classes. Point location and point
insertion are supported. The Delaunay complex also supports point removal.}
