The goal of the CGAL Open Source Project is to provide easy access to
efficient and reliable geometric algorithms in the form of a C++
library. CGAL is used in various areas needing geometric computation,
such as: computer graphics, scientific visualization, computer aided
design and modeling, geographic information systems, molecular
biology, medical imaging, robotics and motion planning, mesh
generation, numerical methods... More on the projects using CGAL web
page.

The Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL), offers data
structures and algorithms like triangulations (2D constrained
triangulations and Delaunay triangulations in 2D and 3D, periodic
triangulations in 3D), Voronoi diagrams (for 2D and 3D points, 2D
additively weighted Voronoi diagrams, and segment Voronoi diagrams),
polygons (Boolean operations, offsets, straight skeleton), polyhedra
(Boolean operations), arrangements of curves and their applications
(2D and 3D envelopes, Minkowski sums), mesh generation (2D Delaunay
mesh generation and 3D surface and volume mesh generation, skin
surfaces), geometry processing (surface mesh simplification,
subdivision and parameterization, as well as estimation of local
differential properties, and approximation of ridges and umbilics),
alpha shapes, convex hull algorithms (in 2D, 3D and dD), search
structures (kd trees for nearest neighbor search, and range and
segment trees), interpolation (natural neighbor interpolation and
placement of streamlines), shape analysis, fitting, and distances
(smallest enclosing sphere of points or spheres, smallest enclosing
ellipsoid of points, principal component analysis), and kinetic data
structures.

All these data structures and algorithms operate on geometric objects
like points and segments, and perform geometric tests on them. These
objects and predicates are regrouped in CGAL Kernels.

Finally, the Support Library offers geometric object generators and
spatial sorting functions, as well as a matrix search framework and a
solver for linear and quadratic programs. It further offers interfaces
to third party software such as the GUI libraries Qt, Geomview, and
the Boost Graph Library.  License

CGAL is distributed under a dual-license scheme. CGAL can be used
together with Open Source software free of charge. Using CGAL in other
contexts can be done by obtaining a commercial license from
GeometryFactory. For more details see the License page.
