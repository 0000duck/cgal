\page general_intro Getting Started with %CGAL

- \subpage usage describes the few steps required to build a program using \cgal.

- \subpage thirdparty lists the third party libraries on which \cgal depends, or for which \cgal provides interfaces.

- \subpage manual gives an idea of where you should look for documentation.

- \subpage preliminaries lists how to control inlining, thread safety, code deprecation, checking of pre- and postconditions, and how to alter the failure behavior.

Once you are familiar with building your programs with \cgal and how the documentation is structured,
you can head over to the \ref tutorials for a hand-in-hand introduction to \cgal data structures
and algorithms, or directly to the package(s) that interest you the \ref packages. Each package
contains simple examples of the various functionalities of the package.
