\cgal is a library that has mandatory dependencies that must be first installed:
\ref thirdpartyBoost and \ref thirdpartyMPFR.

You have two options to install mandatory dependencies: you can either use
the vcpkg library manager, which will automatically install an appropriate version of
these dependencies as you install \cgal, or you can install the dependencies on your own
(making sure that you are using a supported version) by following their respective
installation instructions.

If you choose to use `vcpkg`, you might have to bootstrap and download
and compile it, but from then on `vcpkg` will make your life easier.

[You may opt for not using `vcpkg` because you upgraded and you already
have installed boost, or you need a specific boost version, and not
the latest one, which you would get with `vcpkg`.]

We explain the two approaches in the next sections.

\section sec-installing-with-vcpkg Installing CGAL with the vcpkg Library Manager

\subsection ssec-vcpk-install-vcpk Installing vcpkg

The first step is to clone or download `vcpkg` from
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg">https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg</a>.

\code{.sh}
  C:\dev> git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
  C:\dev> cd vcpkg
  C:\dev\vcpkg> .\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
  C:\dev\vcpkg> .\vcpkg integrate install
\endcode

The last step requires to run `cmd` with administrator rights.

\subsection ssec-vcpk-install-cgal Installing CGAL Itself

By default `vcpkg` installs for 32 bit binaries and will use the latest version of Visual C++
installed on your machine.   If you develop 64 bit software you must
set the Windows environment variable `VCPKG_DEFAULT_TRIPLE` to `x64-windows`
or pass the option `--triplet x64-windows` whenever you install a package.
We refer to the
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/blob/master/docs/examples/installing-and-using-packages.md#step-2-use">official documentation</a>
of `vcpkg` if you want to compile for an older version of a compiler.

You are now ready to install \cgal:

\code{.sh}
  C:\dev\vcpkg> ./vcpkg.exe install cgal
\endcode

This will take roughly 15 minutes and it downloads MPIR (a fork of GMP),
MPFR, all boost header files, and it will compile MPIR and MPFR, as well
as several boost libraries.
Afterwards, you will find the include files, libraries, and dlls in the
subdirectory `C:\dev\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows`.

Note that \cgal is a header-only library, and there is therefore no `lib` or `dll` files.

\subsection ssec-vcpkg-compile-example Compiling an Example

Let's next compile a program that uses \cgal.
The examples you find in these User Manual pages are not downloaded when you install \cgal
with the vcpkg library manager and you must download them separately from the following download page:
<a href="https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/releases/CGAL-\cgalReleaseNumber-examples.zip">CGAL-\cgalReleaseNumber-examples.zip</a>

Assuming you have unzipped this file in your home directory, we will
next compile an example from the 2D Triangulation package.

\subsubsection sssec-vcpkg-configuration-example Configuring of an Example

Before building anything using \cgal, you have to choose the compiler/linker, set compiler
and linker flags, specify which third-party libraries you want to use and where they can be found.
Gathering all this information is called *configuration* and we use CMake as configuration tool
(see Section \ref seccmake for more information on supported versions and where to download it).

The end of the process is marked by the generation of a Visual \cpp solution
and a project file that you can use to build your program.

\code{.sh}
  C:\Users\Me\CGAL-5.0> cd examples\Triangulation_2
  C:\Users\Me\CGAL-5.0\examples\Triangulation_2> mkdir build
  C:\Users\Me\CGAL-5.0\examples\Triangulation_2> cd build
  C:\Users\Me\CGAL-5.0\examples\Triangulation_2\build> cmake-gui .. # cmake-gui is the graphical interface for cmake, which we recommend to use
\endcode

When you hit the `Configure` button, you must:
<ul>
<li>specify the `Generator` (e.g., Visual Studio 16 2019),</li>
<li>specify the `Optional Platform` (e.g., `x64` in case you want to create 64 bit binaries),</li>
<li>select `Specify toolchain file for cross compilation` (the file `vcpkg.cmake` within the directory
where you have installed `vcpkg`, e.g. `C:/dev/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake`).</li>
</ul>
Once the configuration process is done, tick `Advanced` and `Grouped` in `cmake-gui`.
You will see entries for where header files and libraries are taken from.

\subsubsection sssect-vcpkg-additional-dependencies Additional Dependencies

Some \cgal packages also have additional dependencies. During the configuration
of the above examples, you may have observed the following message:

\code{.sh}
  NOTICE: a few examples require Qt and will not be compiled.
\endcode

\cgal is a library of algorithms and data structures and as such does
not depend on `Qt`. However, one of the examples in the Triangulation_2 package does require `Qt`
for visualization purposes. If you already have `Qt` installed, you can simply fill in the requested
CMake variables and paths. Otherwise, you can also install it using `vcpkg`:

\code{.sh}
  C:\dev\vcpkg> .\vcpkg.exe install qt5
\endcode

Remember to specify `--triplet` or the related environment variable in case you target 64-bit applications.

When you start `cmake-gui` again and hit the `Configure` button,
the CMake variables and paths concerning Qt should now be filled.

Note that not all optional dependencies are available through the `vcpkg` library manager.
In this case, you must download and install them independently (see page \ref thirdparty
for information on support versions and download links) as well as fill the missing information
within the `CMake` interface until configuration is successful (no more red lines indicating
missing dependencies).

\cgalAdvancedBegin
You may also decide to solve missing dependencies using the `CMake` command line tool (which is not recommended).
If so, the page \ref configurationvariables lists variables which can be used to specify
the location of third-party software.
\cgalAdvancedEnd

\subsubsection sssect-vcpkg-compilation Compilation of an Example

Hit the `Generate` button, and you will find the file `Triangulation_2_examples.sln`
in the directory `C:\Users\Me\CGAL-5.0\examples\Triangulation_2\build`.
Double-click it to open it. There is one project per `.cpp` file in the directory.
Compile them all, or just the one you are interested in.

\subsection subsect-vpckg-my-code Configuring and Compiling My Code Using CGAL

Configuring and compiling your own code is practically the same as for \cgal examples
if you use `cmake`. Running `cmake` (or `cmake-gui`) requires a `CMakeLists.txt` file.
This file is automatically provided for all examples and demos of \cgal. For your own programs,
you are advised to look at the `CMakeLists.txt` files in the example
folder of the package that you are using to learn how to specify CGAL and additional third party
dependencies.

\section install-with-installer Installing with the Installer

You can download and run `CGAL-\cgalReleaseNumber``-Setup.exe` from https://www.cgal.org/download/windows.html.
It is a self extracting executable that downloads the \cgal header files, and optionally the source code of the
examples and demos. Additionally, it can download precompiled versions of GMP and MPFR.

\subsection ssect-installer-boost Installing `Boost`

Binary versions of `Boost` are available on SourceForge.

The installers install both `Boost` headers and precompiled libraries.
Please note that the \cgal project is not responsible for the files provided on this website.
When \cgal \cgalReleaseNumber was released, the latest version of `Boost` was 1.71.

<ul>
<li>Download and run the file boost_1_71_0-msvc-XX.Y-64.exe (where XX.Y = 14.0 for VC 2015, XX.Y = 14.1 for 2017, XX.Y = 14.2 for VC 2019).</li>
<li>Extract the files to a new directory, e.g. `c:\dev\libboost_1_71_0`.</li>
<li>Set the following two environment variables to point respectively to the path of the libraries and the headers

\code{.sh}
  BOOST_LIBRARYDIR=C:\dev\libboost_1_71_0\lib64-msvc-XX.Y
  BOOST_INCLUDEDIR=C:\dev\libboost_1_71_0
\endcode

as this will help `cmake` to find Boost.</li>
<li>Add the path to the Boost `dlls` (`C:\dev\libboost_1_71_0\lib64-msvc-XX.Y`) files to the `PATH` environment variable.</li>
</ul>

\subsection ssect-installer-install-cgal Installing CGAL Itself

Download and run `CGAL-\cgalReleaseNumber``-Setup.exe` from <
a href="https://www.cgal.org/download/windows.html">https://www.cgal.org/download/windows.html</a>.
It is a self extracting executable that downloads the \cgal header files, and optionally the source code of the
examples and demos. Additionally, it can download the precompiled versions of GMP and Mpfr.  You must
specify if yoy want the 32 or the 64 bit versions of these two libraries.

\cgal being a header-only library, there is no need to compile it.  Set the environment variable `CGAL_DIR` to `C:\dev\CGAL-5.0,
as this will help `cmake` to find \cgal.

\subsection ssect-installer-compile-example Compiling an Example

We assume you have downloaded the examples with the installer.

Before building anything using \cgal, you have to choose the compiler/linker, set compiler
and linker flags, specify which third-party libraries you want to use and where they can be found.
Gathering all this information is called *configuration* and we use CMake as configuration tool
(see Section \ref seccmake for more information on minimal supported versions and where to
download it).

The end of the process is marked by the generation of a Visual \cpp solution
and a project file that you can use to build your program.

\code{.sh}
  C:\dev\CGAL-5.0> cd examples\Triangulation_2
  C:\dev\CGAL-5.0\examples\Triangulation_2> mkdir build
  C:\dev\CGAL-5.0\examples\Triangulation_2> cd build
  C:\dev\CGAL-5.0\examples\Triangulation_2\build> cmake-gui .. # cmake-gui is the graphical interface for cmake, which we recommend to use
\endcode

When you hit the `Configure` button you must:
<ul>
<li>Specify the `Generator`, e.g., Visual Studio 16 2019), and</li>
<li>specify an `Optional Platform` (`x64` in case you want to create 64 bit binaries).</li>
</ul>
Once the configuration is done, tick `Advanced` and `Grouped` in `cmake-gui.
You will see entries for where header files and libraries are taken from.

\subsubsection ssect-installer-additional-dependencies Additional Dependencies

Individual \cgal packages may also have additional dependencies. During the configuration
of the above examples, you may have observed the following message:

\code{.sh}
  NOTICE: a few examples require Qt and will not be compiled.
\endcode

\cgal is a library of algorithms and data structures and as such does
not depend on Qt. However, one of the examples does for visualization purposes only. Either you
have Qt installed and you can fill in the requested CMake variables, or we install it now.

<ul>
<li>
Download and install the Qt library for open source development package for your Visual Studio version at
<a href="https://www.qt.io/download/">https://www.qt.io/download/</a>
(here is the direct link to the <a href="https://www1.qt.io/offline-installers/">offline installers</a>).</li>
<li>Add the environment variable `QTDIR` pointing to the place you installed Qt, e.g., `C:\dev\Qt\Qt5.13.1`,
as this will help `cmake` to find Qt.</li>
<li>Add the bin directory of Qt, e.g. add  `C:\dev\Qt\Qt5.13.1\msvcXXXX_YY\bin` to `PATH`, where `XXXX_YY` is something like `vc2017_64`.
To avoid any conflict with another dll with the same name from another folder, add this path as the first in the list.</li>
<li>When you start `cmake-gui` again and hit the `Configure` button,
the CMake variables concerning Qt should now be filled.</li>
</ul>

You must follow a similar process for other dependencies (see page \ref thirdparty for information
on supported versions of third party libraries as well as download links).

\subsubsection sssect-installer-compilation Compilation of an Example

Hit the `Generate` button, and you will find the file `Triangulation_2_examples.sln`
in the directory `C:\dev\CGAL-5.0\examples\Triangulation_2\build`.
Double click in order to open it. You will see one project per `.cpp` file.
Compile them all or just the one you are interested in.

\subsection subsect-installer-my-code Configuring and Compiling My Code Using CGAL

Configuring and compiling your own code is practically the same as for \cgal examples
if you use `cmake`. Running `cmake` (or `cmake-gui`) requires a `CMakeLists.txt` file.
This file is automatically provided for all examples and demos of \cgal. For your own programs,
you are advised to look at the `CMakeLists.txt` files in the example
folder of the package that you are using to learn how to specify CGAL and additional third party
dependencies.

\section install-with-tarball Installing from the tarball

Instead of the installer you can also download release tarballs. The sole difference with the installer
procedure is that the installer also downloads precompiled GMP and MPFR libraries.
