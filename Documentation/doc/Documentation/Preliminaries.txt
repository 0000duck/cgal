The chapter further explains how to control inlining, thread safety,
code deprecation, checking of pre- and postconditions,
and how to alter the failure behavior.

\section markingSpecialFunctionality Marking of Special Functionality

In this manual you will encounter sections marked as follows.

\subsection advanced_features Advanced Features

Some functionality is considered more advanced, for example because it is
relatively low-level, or requires special care to be properly used.

\cgalAdvancedBegin
Such functionality is identified this way in the manual.
\cgalAdvancedEnd

\subsection debugging_support Debugging Support Features

Usually related to advanced features that for example may not guarantee
class invariants, some functionality is provided that helps debugging,
for example by performing invariants checks on demand.

\cgalDebugBegin
Such functionality is identified this way in the manual.
\cgalDebugEnd

\subsection deprecated_code Deprecated Code

Sometimes, the \cgal project decides that a feature is deprecated.  This means
that it still works in the current release, but it will be removed in the next,
or a subsequent release.  This can happen when we have found a better way to do
something, and we would like to reduce the maintenance cost of \cgal at some
point in the future.  There is a trade-off between maintaining backward
compatibility and implementing new features more easily.

In order to help users manage the changes to apply to their code, we attempt
to make \cgal code emit warnings when deprecated code is used.  This can be
done using some compiler specific features.  Those warnings can be disabled
by defining the macro `CGAL_NO_DEPRECATION_WARNINGS`.  On top of this, we
also provide a macro, `CGAL_NO_DEPRECATED_CODE`, which, when defined,
disables all deprecated features.  This allows users to easily test if their
code relies on deprecated features.

\deprecated Such functionality is identified this way in the manual.

\section Preliminaries_namespace Namespace CGAL

All names introduced by \cgal, especially those documented in these
manuals, are in a namespace called `CGAL`, which is in global
scope. A user can either qualify names from \cgal by adding
`CGAL::`, e.g., `CGAL::Point_2< CGAL::Exact_predicates_inexact_constructions_kernel >`,
make a single name from \cgal visible in a scope via a `using`
statement, e.g., `using CGAL::Point_2;`, and then use this name
unqualified in this scope, or even make all names from namespace
`CGAL` visible in a scope with `using namespace CGAL;`. The
latter, however, is likely to give raise to name conflicts and is
therefore not recommended.


\section Preliminaries_thread_safety Thread Safety

\cgal is progressively being made thread-safe.  The guidelines which are followed
are:

- it should be possible to use different objects in different threads at the same time (of the same type or not),
- it is not safe to access the same object from different threads at the same time, unless otherwise specified in the class documentation.

If the macro `CGAL_HAS_THREADS` is not defined, then \cgal assumes it can use
any thread-unsafe code (such as static variables).  By default, this macro is not
defined, unless `BOOST_HAS_THREADS` or `_OPENMP` is defined.  It is possible
to force its definition on the command line, and it is possible to prevent its default
definition by setting `CGAL_HAS_NO_THREADS` from the command line.

\section Preliminaries_cc0x C++14 Support

After being based on the \CC standard released in 1998 (and later refined in 2003) for a long time,
\cgal is now based on a newer major version of the standard, C++14.

\section Preliminaries_functor Functor Return Types

\cgal functors support the
<a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/utility/utility.htm#result_of">result_of</a>
protocol. If a functor `F` has the same return type across all
overloads of `operator()`, the nested type
`F::result_type` is defined to be that type. Otherwise the
return type of calling the functor with an argument of type
`Arg` can be accessed through \link CGAL::cpp11::result_of::type `CGAL::cpp11::result_of<F(Arg)>::type` \endlink.

\section preliminaries_secchecks Checks

Much of the \cgal code contains assert statements for preconditions, and postconditions of functions
as well as in the code.  These assertions can be switched on and off per package
and the user can change the error behaviour. For details see Section \ref secchecks
of Chapter \ref Chapter_STL_Extensions_for_CGAL.

\section Preliminaries_flags Compile-time Flags to Control Inlining

Making functions inlined can, at times, improve the efficiency of your code.
However this is not always the case and it can differ for a single function
depending on the application in which it is used. Thus \cgal defines a set
of compile-time macros that can be used to control whether certain functions
are designated as inlined functions or not.  The following table lists the
macros and their default values, which are set in one of the \cgal include
files.

| Macro Name                   | Default |
| :---------                   | :------ |
| `CGAL_KERNEL_INLINE`         | inline  |
| `CGAL_KERNEL_MEDIUM_INLINE`  |         |
| `CGAL_KERNEL_LARGE_INLINE`   |         |
| `CGAL_MEDIUM_INLINE`         | inline  |
| `CGAL_LARGE_INLINE`          |         |
| `CGAL_HUGE_INLINE`           |         |

If you wish to change the value of one or more of these macros,
you can simply give it a new value when compiling.  For example, to make
functions that use the macro `CGAL_KERNEL_MEDIUM_INLINE` inline functions,
you should set the value of this macro to `inline` instead of the
default blank.

Note that setting inline manually is very fragile, especially in a template
context.  It is usually better to let the compiler select by himself which
functions should be inlined or not.
