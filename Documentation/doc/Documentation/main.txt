The Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (\cgal) is a software project
that provides easy access to efficient and reliable geometric algorithms
in the form of a C++ library.

\cgal offers data structures and algorithms like \ref PartTriangulationsAndDelaunayTriangulations "triangulations",
\ref PartVoronoiDiagrams "Voronoi diagrams", \ref PartPolygons, \ref PartPolyhedra,
\ref PartArrangements "arrangements of curves", \ref PartMeshing "mesh generation",
\ref PartGeometryProcessing "geometry processing", \ref PartConvexHullAlgorithms "convex hull algorithms",
to name just a few.

All these data structures and algorithms operate on geometric objects
like points and segments, and perform geometric tests on them. These
objects and predicates are regrouped in \ref PartKernels "CGAL Kernels".

Finally, the \ref PartSupportLibrary "Support Library" offers geometric object generators and
spatial sorting functions, as well as a matrix search framework and a
solver for linear and quadratic programs. It further offers interfaces
to third party software such as the GUI libraries Qt, Geomview, and
the Boost Graph Library.

Getting Started
===============


- \ref usage describes how to get \cgal and the few steps required to build a program using \cgal.

- \ref thirdparty lists required and optional third party libraries.

- \ref manual gives an idea of where you should look for documentation.

- \ref preliminaries lists how to control inlining, thread safety, code deprecation, checking of pre- and postconditions, and how to alter the failure behavior.

Once you are familiar with building your programs with \cgal and how the documentation is structured,
you can head over to the \ref tutorials for a hand-in-hand introduction to \cgal data structures
and algorithms, or directly to the package(s) that interest you the \ref packages. Each package
contains simple examples of the various functionalities of the package.
