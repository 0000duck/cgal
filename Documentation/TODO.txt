# Things that would be nice to have #

## Search ##
The search function could be better: 
- member functions could be removed
- global functions could be searchable
- package codenames could be supported

## Function Documentation ##

Automatic grouping of overloads or a switch to document functions in a
style more similar to classes, e.g. with their own page.

## Global Build Version ##

I have no idea how feasible that actually is, but it might be worth a
try.

## Package Overview ##

Build the Package Overview with the help of the Build System. First,
modularize CGAL. Also add dependency management.
