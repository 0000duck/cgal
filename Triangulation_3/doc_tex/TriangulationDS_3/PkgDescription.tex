\ccPkgSummary{
This package provides a data structure to store a three-dimensional
triangulation that has the topology of a three-dimensional sphere. 
The package acts as a container for the vertices 
and cells of the triangulation 
and provides basic  combinatorial operations on the triangulation.}
