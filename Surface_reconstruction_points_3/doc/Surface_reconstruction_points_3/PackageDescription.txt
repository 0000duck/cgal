\PkgDesc{This \cgal package implements a surface reconstruction method: Poisson Surface Reconstruction. It takes as input a set of points with oriented normals and computes an implicit function. The \cgal surface mesh generator can then be used to extract an iso-surface from this function. }

\PkgDescriptionEnd

This \cgal component implements a state-of-the-art surface
reconstruction method: Poisson Surface Reconstruction. The input is an
unorganized point set, possibly with attributes such as unoriented or
oriented normals. The output is either an implicit function (ready for
evaluation by any contouring algorithm), or a surface mesh generated
by the \cgal surface mesh generator.

Note that since reconstruction methods often require pre-processing a
point set (through reduction, smoothing, outlier removal, normal
estimation, normal orientation), we provide components devoted to
these tasks in the Point Set Processing component.
