\subsection{Input and Preprocessing}

This component expects as input parameters range iterators over sets of 3D points with \emph{oriented normals}. Such data sets are assumed to contain little noise and no outliers. Chapter \ccc{Point_set_processing_3} \ref{chap:point_set_processing_3} provides methods to read such data sets from files as well as algorithms to simplify, remove outliers, denoise, estimate normales and orient normals.
