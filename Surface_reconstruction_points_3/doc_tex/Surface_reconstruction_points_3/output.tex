\section{Output}

The surface reconstructed by \ccc{make_surface_mesh()} is required to be a model of the concept \ccc{SurfaceMeshComplex_2InTriangulation_3}, a data structure devised to represent a two dimensional complex embedded into a three dimensional triangulation. \ccc{SurfaceMeshComplex_2InTriangulation_3} defines the methods to traverse the reconstructed surface.

We provide functions to write the reconstructed surface mesh to the OFF file format, to convert the reconstructed surface mesh to a polygon soup, and to convert the reconstructed surface mesh to a polyhedron when it is manifold.
