Surface Reconstruction from Point Sets

Pierre Alliez, Laurent Saboret, Gael Guennebaud, Mariette Yvinec

This CGAL package implements two implicit surface reconstruction methods (Poisson surface reconstruction and Algebraic Point Set Surfaces). The input is an unorganized point set with oriented normals. The output is either an implicit function (ready for evaluation by any contouring algorithm), or a surface mesh generated by the CGAL surface mesh generator.
