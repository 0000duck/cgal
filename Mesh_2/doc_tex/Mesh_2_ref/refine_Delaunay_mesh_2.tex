  covers all the connected components of the plane defined by the
  constrained edges of \ccc{t}, except for the unbounded component.
  \ccPrecond The template parameter \ccc{CDT} must be a model of the
  concept \ccc{ConstrainedDelaunayTriangulation_2}. The geometric traits
  class of the constrained Delaunay triangulation must be a model
  of \ccc{DelaunayMeshTraits_2}.
  \ccRequire The face of the constrained
  Delaunay triangulation must be a model of the concept
  \ccc{DelaunayMeshFaceBase_2}. \ccc{Criteria} must be a model of the
  concept \ccc{MeshingCriteria_2} and \ccc{CDT::Face_handle} must be the same

                       gives a set of seeds points, that defines the domain

                       \ccc{t} partition the plane into connected components.
                       If \ccc{mark=true}, the mesh domain is the union of
                       the bounded connected components including at least
                       one seed. If \ccc{mark=false}, the domain is the
                       union of the bounded components including no seed.
                       Note that the unbounded component of the plane is
                       never meshed.
