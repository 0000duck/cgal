=== POSTPONED

The periodic regular triangulation is not implemented. This will need
a different criterion here for changing from the 3x3 cover to the 1x1
cover. An outline is given in the ESA paper.

The 2D periodic triangulation implements a (Delaunay) triangulation on
the 2-torus. For the Euclidean triangulation there exist interfaces
with other packages. These have not been implemented for the periodic
triangulation. The interfaces are:

* There is no compatibility with the mesher.
* The interface with the 2D alpha is not tested.
