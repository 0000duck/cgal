\PkgDescriptionEnd

This chapter describes the functions and classes provided in \cgal
that are useful for generating synthetic test data sets, <I>e.g.,</I>
for testing algorithms on degenerate object sets and for performance
analysis.  These include a class for generating random numbers and
function for selecting random items from a set of objects, generators
for two-dimensional and three-dimensional points sets, a generator for
random convex sets and one for simple polygons.  The \stl algorithm
`std::random_shuffle` is useful with these functions and classes to to
achieve random permutations for otherwise regular generators (
<I>e.g.</I>, points on a grid or segment).
