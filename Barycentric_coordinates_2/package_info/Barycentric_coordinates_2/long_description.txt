The package <em>2D Generalized Barycentric Coordinates</em> offers an efficient and robust implementation of two-dimensional closed-form generalized barycentric coordinates defined for simple two-dimensional polygons. If coordinates with respect to multivariate scattered points instead of a polygon are required, please refer to natural neighbour coordinates from the package \ref chapinterpolation "2D and Surface Function Interpolation".
