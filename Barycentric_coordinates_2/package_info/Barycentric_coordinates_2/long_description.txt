2D Generalized Barycentric Coordinates package offers three different types of closed-form generalized barycentric coordinates defined for some sets of simple polygons. In particular, it includes an implementation of Wachspress, Mean Value, and Discrete Harmonic coordinates together with special cases for triangles and segments.
