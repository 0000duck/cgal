\section intro Understanding the Polyhedron demo

These pages are not documenting the whole Polyhedron demo but only the API that can be useful to create and add a new plugin.

There are several levels in this demo. 

- The MainWindow, which contains the UI elements. 

- Among these elements is the Viewer, which is the drawable surface that handles all the drawing and all the keyboard and mouse events. 

- The Viewer has a reference to the Scene, which contains the Scene_item list, which is a list of the drawn elements. 

A plugin usually defines an object that inherits from Scene_item or uses some of them to demonstrate a CGAL feature, so it might have to deal with the above elements.

\section examplePlugin Creating a simple Plugin
\subsection examplePluginItself The plugin itself
A basic plugin will inherit from Polyhedron_demo_plugin_interface. It can also inherits from the Polyhedron_demo_plugin_helper instead, for a more detailed model of plugin.
Its name must be of the form Polyhedron_demo_xxxx_yyyy_plugin. \n
<b>In the CMakeList.txt file, in the section Plugins, add the following lines :</b>

    polyhedron_demo_plugin(xxxx_yyyy_plugin Polyhedron_demo_xxxx_yyyy_plugin)
    
<b>If your plugin interacts with scene items, then you have to add the following line too :</b>
    target_link_libraries(xxxx_yyyy_plugin scene_polyhedron_item) 
      
  [init]: @ref Polyhedron_demo_plugin_helper#init(QMainWindow *, Scene_interface *)
  The class must contain the following lines :\n
  
    Q_OBJECT\n
    Q_INTERFACES(Polyhedron_demo_plugin_interface)\n
    Q_PLUGIN_METADATA(IID "com.geometryfactory.PolyhedronDemo.PluginInterface/1.0")\n
    
In the function [init], get a reference to the Scene  and to the MainWindow. Then, create and link the actions of the plugin.\n
Create a list of QActions containing the actions of the plugin.\n
Add the following line:

    actionName->setProperty("submenuName", "Name_you_want_for_your_submenu");
    
to place your action in a submenu in the Operation Menu.\n
If the plugin implements a new Scene_item, please notice that a Scene_item has a number of functions that will need a reference to the Viewer through the Viewer_interface type.

\subsection examplePluginDialog Adding a dialog

This section describes how to add a dialog on the use of an action.

For a minimalist dialog, intended to get a single parameter for instancem you can create a QInputDialog :

    const unsigned int parameter =
      QInputDialog::getInt((QWidget*)mw,
                           tr("Title"), // dialog title
                           tr("Parameter's value:"), // field label
                           10, // default value = fast
                           0, // min
                           100, // max
                           1, // step
                           &ok);
    if(!ok) return;
    
    

For a more elaborate interface, you will have to use the designer tool of QtCreator. Create a new Qt Designer form (file->New file or Project->Qt), name it Polyhedron_demo_your_plugin_name_plugin_dialog 




\subsection examplePluginDockWidget Adding a dock widget



A plugin must always contain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
#include "Polyhedron_demo_xxxx_yyyy_plugin.moc"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

\section usefulItems List of useful classes :
- MainWindow
- CGAL::Three::Viewer_interface
- CGAL::Three::Scene_interface
- Scene_item
- CGAL::Three::Polyhedron_demo_plugin_helper
- CGAL::Three::Polyhedron_demo_plugin_interface


\section example Example : 

The following code will create a plugin that adds an action to the MainWindow. This action is called "Draw Triangle" and adds a triangle to the scene.
