The class `Spatial_grid_lock_data_structure_3` allows to lock 
point coordinates (x, y, z) in a 3D grid. For example, it can be used by 
concurrent algorithms to lock simplices.

\tparam Grid_lock_tag allows to choose the locking strategy used by the
structure. The following tags are available:
- `Tag_non_blocking_with_atomics` is non-blocking (i.e. try_lock will always
return immediately) and uses atomics to perform lock operations.
- `Tag_non_blocking_with_mutexes` is non-blocking (i.e. try_lock will always
return immediately) and uses mutexes to perform lock operations.
- `Tag_priority_blocking_with_atomics` provides both non-blocking and
partially-blocking `try_lock` versions. The partially-blocking version will 
block (spin) if the thread owning the lock has a "lower ID" (each thread is 
given an arbitrary ID) or return immediately otherwise. It uses atomics to 
perform lock operations.
