\PkgDesc{This package consists of functions that compute the Minkowski sum of two simple straight-edge polygons in the plane. It also contains functions for computing the Minkowski sum of a polygon and a disc, an operation known as <I>offsetting</I> or <I>dilating</I> a polygon. The package can compute the exact representation of the offset polygon, or provide a guaranteed approximation of the offset.}

\PkgDescriptionEnd

This package consist of functions for computing the Minkowksi sum
of two polygons in the plane. Namely, given two polygons \f$ P,Q \in
\mathbb{R}^2\f$ it computes \f$ P \oplus Q = \left\{ p + q ~|~ p \in P,
q \in Q \right\}\f$.

In addition, the package also includes functions for offsetting a
polygon, namely computing its Minkowski sum with a disc of a given
radius, and for insetting a polygon (namely computing its inner
offset). It is possible to compute the exact representation of the
offset (or the inset), or to approximate it with guaranteed error
bounds, in order to speed up the computation time.
