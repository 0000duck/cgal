\ccDefinition
  
The class \ccRefName\ 
is designed to maintain the
regular triangulation of a set of weighted points.


Let ${  PW} = \{(p_i, w_i), i = 1, \ldots , n \}$ be a set of 
weighted points where each $p_i$ is a point and each $w_i$
is a scalar called the weight of point $p_i$.
Alternatively, each weighted point $(p_i, w_i)$ can be regarded
as a two dimensional sphere with center $p_i$ and radius $r_i=\sqrt{w_i}$.

The power diagram of the set ${  PW}$ is a planar partition 
such that each cell corresponds to sphere $(p_i, w_i)$ of ${  PW}$
and is the locus of points  $p$ whose power with respect to $(p_i, w_i)$
is less than its power with respect to any other sphere $(p_j, w_j)$
in ${  PW}$. 
The dual of this diagram is a triangulation 
whose domain covers the convex hull of the set 
${  P}= \{ p_i, i = 1, \ldots , n \}$ of center points
and whose vertices are a subset of ${  P}$.
Such a triangulation is called a regular triangulation.
The  three points $p_i, p_j$ and $p_k$ of ${  P}$
form a triangle in the regular triangulation of ${  PW}$
iff there is a point $p$ of the plane whose
powers with respect to $(p_i, w_i)$, $(p_j, w_j)$
and $(p_k, w_k)$ are equal and less than the power of $p$
with respect to any other sphere in  ${  PW}$.

Let us defined the power product of two weighted points
$(p_i, w_i)$ and $(p_j, w_j)$ as:
\[\Pi(p_i, w_i,p_j, w_j) = p_ip_j ^2 - w_i  - w_j  .\]
$\Pi(p_i, w_i,p_j, 0)$ is simply the power of point $p_j$
with respect to the sphere $(p_i, w_i)$, and two weighted points 
are said to be orthogonal if their power product is null.
The power circle of three weighted points
 $(p_i, w_i)$, $(p_j, w_j)$
and $(p_k, w_k)$ is defined as the unique circle
$(\pi, \omega)$  orthogonal to
 $(p_i, w_i)$, $(p_j, w_j)$
and $(p_k, w_k)$.

The regular triangulation of the sets ${  PW}$
satisfies the following {\em regular property} (which just reduces to the 
Delaunay property when all the weights are null):
a triangle $p_ip_jp_k$ of the regular triangulation
of ${  PW}$ is such that the power product of any weighted point
 $(p_l, w_l)$ of ${  PW}$ with the power circle of
 $(p_i, w_i)$, $(p_j, w_j)$ is $(p_k, w_k)$ is positive or null.
We call  power test of the weighted point $(p_l, w_l)$ with respect
to the face  $p_ip_jp_k$, the predicates testing
the sign of 
the power product of $(p_l, w_l)$ with respect to
the power circle of
 $(p_i, w_i)$, $(p_j, w_j)$ is $(p_k, w_k)$. This power product
is given by the following
determinant
\[\left| \begin{array}{cccc}
1  &  x_i  &  y_i  &  x_i ^2 + y_i ^2 - w_i  \\
1  &  x_j  &  y_j  &  x_j ^2 + y_j ^2 - w_j  \\
1  &  x_k  &  y_k  &  x_k ^2 + y_k ^2 - w_k  \\
1  &  x_l  &  y_l  &  x_l ^2 + y_l ^2 - w_l
\end{array}
\right|
\]

A pair of neighboring faces $p_ip_jp_k$
and $p_ip_jp_l$ is said to be locally regular
(with respect to  the weights in ${  PW}$)
if the power test of $(p_l,w_l)$ with respect to
$p_ip_jp_k$ is positive.
A classical  result of computational geometry
establishes that a triangulation of the convex hull of ${  P}$
such that any pair of neighboring faces is regular with respect
to ${  PW}$, is a
 regular triangulation of ${  PW}$.

Alternatively, the regular triangulation
of the weighted points set ${  PW}$
can be obtained as the projection
on the two dimensional plane of the convex hull of the set of three
dimensional points 
${  P'}= \{ (p_i,p_i ^2 - w_i ), i = 1, \ldots , n \}$.

The vertices of the regular triangulation
of a set of weighted points ${  PW}$ form only a subset
of the set of center points of ${   PW}$.
Therefore the  insertion of a weighted point  in a regular triangulation
does not necessarily imply the creation of a new vertex.
If the new inserted point does not appear as a vertex in the
regular triangulation, it is said to be hidden. 

Hidden points
are  stored in special vertices called hidden vertices.
A hidden point is considered as hidden by
the facet of the triangulation where its point component is located :
in fact, the hidden point 
can appear as vertex of the triangulation
only if this facet is removed.
Each  face of a regular triangulation stores
the list of hidden vertices whose points are located in the facet.
When a facet is removed, 
points hidden by this facet are reinserted in the triangulation.

\ccParameters
The geometric traits parameter \ccc{Traits}  has 
to be instantiated with a model of the concept
\ccc{RegularTriangulationTraits_2}. 
The concept \ccc{RegularTriangulationTraits_2} refines the
concept \ccc{TriangulationTraits_2} by adding the type
\ccc{Weighted_point_2} to describe weighted points
and the type \ccc{Power\_test_2} to perform
power tests on weighted points.

The \ccc{Tds} parameter has to be instantiated by a model of
\ccc{TriangulationDataStructure_2}. The face base of a regular
triangulation has to be a model of the concept
\ccc{RegularTriangulationFaceBase_2}.  while
the vertex base class has to be a model
of \ccc{RegularTriangulationVertexBase_2}.
\cgal\ provides a default
instantiation for the \ccc{Tds} parameter by the class
\ccc{CGAL::Triangulation_data_structure_2 <
                       CGAL::Reugular_triangulation_vertex_base_2<Traits>,
                       CGAL::Regular_Triangulation_face_base_2<Traits> >}.
