\ccPkgSummary{This package  allows to build and handle
various triangulations for point sets two dimensions.
Any CGAL triangulation covers the convex hull of its
vertices. Triangulations are build incrementally 
and can be modified by insertion  or removal  of vertices. 
They offer point location facilities.

The package provides plain triangulation (whose faces
depend on the insertion order of the vertices) and
Delaunay triangulations.  Regular triangulations are
also provided for sets of weighted points. Delaunay and regular
triangulations offer nearest neighbor queries
and primitives to build the dual Voronoi and power diagrams. 

Finally, constrained and Delaunay contrained triangulations
allows to force some constrained segments to appear
as edges of the triangulation. 
Several versions of constrained and Delaunay contrained triangulations
are provided: some of them handle intersections between input constraints
segment while others do not. }
