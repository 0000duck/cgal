\ingroup PkgTriangulation2TriangulationClasses

The class `Polyline_constrained_triangulation_2` 
implements a constrained triangulation where the constraints are polylines.
It maintains an additional data structure, called the constraint hierarchy, 
that keeps track of the input constraints and of their refinement 
in the triangulation. 

The class `Polyline_constrained_triangulation_2<Tr>` 
inherits from its template parameter Tr, which has to be instantiated 
by a constrained or constrained Delaunay triangulation. 

According to its intersection tag, the base class 
will support intersecting input constraints or not. 
When intersections of input constraints are supported, 
the base class constructs a triangulation of the arrangement 
of the constraints, 
introducing new vertices at each proper intersection 
point and refining the input constraints into sub-constraints. 
These sub-constraints are constrained edges of the 
triangulation. 
The constraint hierarchy 
keeps track of the input constraints and of their refinement 
in the triangulation. This data structure 
maintains for each input constraints 
the sequence of intersection vertices added on this constraint. 
The constraint hierarchy also allows the user to retrieve the set 
of constrained edges of the triangulation, and for each 
constrained edge, the set of input constraints it overlaps with. 

\tparam Tr must be either a CGAL::Constrained_triangulation_2 or a CGAL::Constrained_Delaunay_triangulation_2
