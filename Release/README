This is what you need to do to create a release:
------------------------------------------------

CVS Release Branch:
-------------------

Before releasing proper, you need to create a branch, and run the internal
release process on this branch for some time.  Experience shows (at least in
3.1) that there is very few development (on the packages to be released) on the
trunc.  So it seems best to branch as late as possible, in order to avoid the
(small) pain of commiting things twice during the final stabilization phase.

For branching, you need to :
  - have write access to all packages
  - cvs co All
  - cvs tag CGAL_M_m_branch_tag
  - cvs tag -b CGAL_M_m_branch

Releasing:
----------

For the library:

Let <release_dir> be the directory in which you plan to build the release.

      1.  update the CHANGES file in this package to correspond to this
          release
      2.  copy the latest internal release to <release_dir>
      3.  unpack it and rename the directory CGAL-M.m
      4.  edit the script release_scripts/make_public_release as instructed
          in the script
      5.  cd CGAL-M.m
      6.  run the script release_scripts/make_public_release to
               Remove non-public parts.
               Find all .C and .h files and collect them in a file
               Edit include/CGAL/version.h
      7.  Copy Release/CHANGES

For the manuals:

      1.  Check out the package Manual from the CVS server and follow the
          instructions in the INSTALL file
      2.  cd Manual
      3.  install_manual_files ?.?-I-??  (number of latest internal release)
      4.  follow the directions in Manual/README to create the
          manuals (but don't install them yet)
      5.  in the CGAL-M.m directory, create doc_ps, doc_pdf and 
          doc_html/installation directories to hold the installation
          doc. Copy the appropriate files from directory
          Manual/CGAL-M.m_doc_tex/installation to these directories.

      6.  For the HTML version in CGAL-M.m/doc_html (NOT in the Manual
          directory), do the following bit of editing:
             remove the navigation links to bibliography, index and title;
             remove the files title.html and manual_index.html, to_html.log.

Package the code:
      1.  In directory <release_dir> do
             find CGAL-M.m -exec touch 01221530 {} \;
           in order to touch all files (Here the date/time  Jan 22, 15:30 was 
           used as an example)
      2.  Make CGAL-M.m.tar.gz with tar and gzip and CGAL-M.m.zip with zip.
           gtar zcf CGAL-M.m.gtar.gz CGAL-M.m
           tar cf CGAL-M.m.tar CGAL-M.m
           gzip CGAL-M.m.tar
           zip -r CGAL-M.m.zip CGAL-M.m
      3.  The .zip file for the code needs to be repackaged for use with
          InstallShield.  Contact the person in charge of Windows support.

For the web pages:
      1.  edit the following web pages (at least)
             Web_pages/news.html            
             Web_pages/in_progress.html            
             Web_pages/download/download.html            
             Web_pages/download/license.html            
             Web_pages/home.html            
             Web_pages/releases.html            
             Web_pages/platforms.html
           change release number in:
           (edit and use Manual/script/rename_version)
             Manual/web_pages/doc_html/frameset/panel*.html 
             Manual/web_pages/doc_html/html_tar.html
             Manual/web_pages/doc_ps/index.html
             Manual/web_pages/doc_pdf/index.html
      2.  update the cgi-bin/cgal_download.pl script to add the new release,
          goes then to /www/pub/cgi-bin/www.cgal.org/
      3.  Perhaps update the download/CGALWin directory with new versions
          of the library for new platforms. [obsolete since CGAL 3.0, Lutz]

Install everything:
      1.  install the manual (and include files) in 
          /www/pub/www.cgal.org/Manual using "make install"
      2.  copy the .tar.gz and .zip files for the library and
          the documentation to /ftp/pub/outgoing/CGAL/
            (can be done with "make pack" for the documentation)
      3.  zip the individual .ps files for the documentation using
          make dest_zip_ps
      4.  install the new web pages, i.e., make a cvs commit in Web_pages/,
          and a 'cvs up' in /www/pub/www.cgal.org/
      5.  cp cgi-bin/cgal_download.pl /www/pub/cgi-bin/www.cgal.org/
      6.  tag CVS : cvs tag CGAL_M_m_release

Then finally ...
      7.  announce the release (see announcement directory)
