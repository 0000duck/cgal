  constructed.  There's a new way of constructing a Handle_for :
  Handle_for(TO_BE_USED_ONLY_WITH_CONSTRUCT_WITH) followed by
  construct_with(), which is supposed to produce more efficient code.
  Simple_handle_for also accepts it.

  add_reference()
  remove_reference()

  The Handle_for does not know anymore, where and how the counting takes
  places. However, it assumes that count is initialized to 1 in default 
  and copy constructor.

  One level of indirection has been removed.
  The code now assumes that dynamic_cast<> is supported.

  typedef PointH2<FT,RT>               Point_2_base;
  typedef CGAL::Point_2< R >           Point_2;

    template <class rt, class ft = Quotient<rt> >
    #else
    template <class rt>

3.51  (9 Oct 2002)

- Make it work with -DCGAL_NO_DEPRECATED, and other fixes.

3.48  (5 Oct 2002)
- Better support expression templates NTs (GMP++).

3.47  (14 Aug 2002)
- added missing test for less_x, less_y

====================== CGAL 2.4 =============================

3.46  (20 March 2002)
- removed Point_d

3.45   (20 March 2002)
- moved LedaKernel test to LEDA package.

3.44   (6 February 2002)
- Add code to test that we can derive from Object.

3.43   (24 January 2002)
- Remove testing code for predicate_classes_2.h, since it has been removed.

3.41   (21 January 2002)
- Remove #ifdefs concerning EGCS.
- Remove implicit conversion for constructor Plane(Origin, Point_3, Point_3).

3.40   (9 January 2002)

3.36   (19 November 2001)
- Remove obsolete #includes.

3.35   (27 September 2001)
- remove the need to have "-I../Kernel/include" in the submitted makefiles,
  by hard coding it in the #includes<> inside the test files.  This way it
  makes it clear in the test files which headers come from CGAL, and which
  come from the test-suite.
- a by product of this is that we can use the default makefiles, and so I
  added "makefile" to dont_submit.
- I added "-I../../H2/include" and similar in the makefiles, so that we can
  work more easily with our working copies (didn't you find it painful to
  have to tweak the makefiles for each submission ?).
- Fixes a buffer overflow which made SunPro 5.3 fail at run time.
