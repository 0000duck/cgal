\section{Projection Traits Classes \label{section-projection-traits}}

It is sometimes useful to apply 2D algorithms to the projection of 3D points on
a plane. Examples are
triangulated terrains, which are points with elevation, or surface 
reconstruction from parallel slices, where one wants to check the simplicity
or orientation of polygons.

For this purpose \cgal\ provides several projection traits classes,
which are a model of traits class concepts of 2D triangulations,
2D polygon and 2D convex hull traits classes.  The projection traits classes 
are listed in the "{\em Is Model for the Concepts}" sections of the concepts.
