\begin{ccRefFunction}{compare_xyz}


Depending on which \cgal\ \ccHtmlNoLinksFrom{kernel} is used,
different versions of this global function are available. This is
described below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{With the basic 3D Kernel} (see Chapter~\ref{chapter-kernel-23})

\ccFunction{Comparison_result
compare_xyz(const Point_3<Kernel>& p, const Point_3<Kernel>& q);}
      {Compares the Cartesian coordinates of points \ccStyle{p} and
       \ccStyle{q} lexicographically in $xyz$ order: first 
       $x$-coordinates are compared, if they are equal, $y$-coordinates
       are compared, and if both $x$- and $y$- coordinate are equal,
       $z$-coordinates are compared.}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{With the 3D Spherical Kernel} (see Chapter~\ref{chapter-spherical-kernel}) 

\ccInclude{CGAL/global_functions_spherical_kernel_3.h}

If this kernel is used, in addition to the function and the
combination of 2D types described above, another version of the function
is provided.

\ccFunction{Comparison_result 
  compare_xyz(const Circular_arc_point_3<SphericalKernel> &p,
            const Circular_arc_point_3<SphericalKernel> &q);}
{Compares the Cartesian coordinates of points \ccStyle{p} and
       \ccStyle{q} lexicographically.}

\ccFunction{Comparison_result 
  compare_xyz(const Circular_arc_point_3<SphericalKernel> &p,
            const Point_3<SphericalKernel> &q);}
{Compares the Cartesian coordinates of points \ccStyle{p} and
       \ccStyle{q} lexicographically.}
