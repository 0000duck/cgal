This directory contains word files ( .aspell.en.prepl and .aspell.en.pws)
and a configuration file (.aspell.conf) that allow to spell-check the CGAL
Manual using the "aspell" program.  Just run it using :

aspell --home-dir=../../../Manual_tools/aspell -c filename.tex


Some notes:

There are currently the following problems with aspell which affect us:
- aspell does not know about LaTeX environments, like \begin{ccRefClass}{MyClass}
  so it attempts to spell-check MyClass, which of course barfs most of the time.
  Note that it knows about LaTeX macros (and e.g. treats \begin and \end as such).
- this also has the consequence that it barfs for \begin{HtmlOnly} pieces, which
  are mostly used for specifying <img src=...>.
- it is not very good at LaTeX accents like Ga\"ertner... I have not attempted
  at switching to e.g. UTF8 accented letters instead.
- code pieces in \begin{ExampleCode} also tend to barf.  Some of them should be
  moved to external .cpp example files (compiled by the test-suite).
- don't forget to set LANG=en_US.

Moreover, I made the choice to have the local word dictionnary containing words
which might be incorrect but largely used or not clearly obviously wrong
(e.g. "halfspace" is there while it might be "half-space").  Such picky fixups
could be performed in a second round of spell-checking.
This first round is especially meant at catching obvious typos.
