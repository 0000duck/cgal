{\bf Note}

{\small These \LaTeX\ style and tools were created during the writing
  of the first versions of the CGAL Kernel Reference Manual and they
  are still evolving. New features are continuously added (even if
  this runs on low priority), so it might happen that the features
  implemented in the style file are non orthogonal, ugly named, and
  inconsistent. Please report errors, anomalies, and suggestions for
  improvements to {\tt <kettner@inf.ethz.ch>}. Please check the latest
  release, for example, available for members on the CGAL Home Page at
  {\tt <http://www.cs.uu.nl/CGAL/Members/>}.}\vspace{2ex}

{\bf Acknowledgements} 

{\small The CGAL Kernel is a group effort \cite{Fabri96,Fabri99} and
  so is the reference manual style, the \LaTeX\ to HTML converter and
  the related tools. I would like to thank Andreas Fabri, Geert-Jan
  Giezeman, Stefan Schirra, and Sven Sch\"onherr for all the
  suggestions and improvements, Susan Hert for taking over maintenance
  of this package, and the LEDA\TTindex{LEDA} group for their manual
  layout \cite{Naeher95} that we have mimicked here.}\vspace{2ex}
