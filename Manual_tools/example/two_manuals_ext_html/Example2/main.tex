\chapter{Second Chapter}

Because the chapter command for this chapter lies in a file named
\texttt{main.tex} and there is also a chapter command in the file
\texttt{Example/main.tex}, any document that contains both of these
chapters must be converted to HTML using the \texttt{-extended} option
of \texttt{cc\_manual\_to\_html}.
