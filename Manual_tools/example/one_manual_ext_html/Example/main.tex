\chapter{Example User Manual}

\ccChapterAuthor{Lutz Kettner and Susan Hert}

This small example illustrates the creation of a single manual with different
chapters for the user manual and reference manual parts.  See the 
\texttt{Makefile} for the commands used to create the manuals.

The file \texttt{html\_wrapper.tex} is used to define formatting commands
used throughout the manual.  There is a link to the file in the parent
directory from each subidirectory so a global change in formatting can
be accomplished by editing a single file.  This wrapper file is
required for such global settings since each file given as an argument to
\texttt{cc\_manual\_to\_html} is converted independently when the
\texttt{-extended} option is used until the end, when information is gathered 
together about all files processed in order to produce hyperlinks and such. 

See the directory \texttt{../two\_manuals\_ext\_html} for an
example of the creation of two manuals in one document using the
\texttt{-ref\_manual} option together with the \texttt{-extended}
option.
