This directory contains several examples of how to create manuals using
the tools in this distribution.

The directory structure is:

    README                 this file.

    Example_ref            Directory containing examples of the C++ reference
                           pages.  See the README file in this directory for
                           documentation of how these files were created.
    Example_ref/main.tex   main LaTeX file for the reference page chapter.
    Example_ref/intro.tex  introduction to this chapter.
    Example_ref/*.tex      the reference pages.
 
    one_manual             example of creation of a single manual 
                           
    one_manual_ext_html    example of creation of a single manual using
                           the -extended option for HTML conversion.
    two_manuals            example of creation of two manuals in a single
                           document using \part commands
    two_manuals_ext_html   example of creation of two manuals in a single
                           document using \part commands and the -extended
                           and -ref_manual options for HTML conversion
    
Each of the last four directories has similar structure.  Namely, each
directory <dir> contains:

     <dir>/Example*/          a directory containing a chapter of the manual.  
     <dir>/Example*/main.tex  file containing an explanation of the example.
                              (the chapter body)
     <dir>/Example_ref        a link to Example_ref in this directory
     <dir>/Makefile           makefile used to produce the manuals
     <dir>/html/contents.html HTML manual
     <dir>/main.tex           file that includes the main.tex files for the
                              manual parts or chapters
     <dir>/manual.ps.gz       PostScript manual
     <dir>/manual.tex         main LaTex file for the manual

The directories one_manual_ext_html and two_manuals_ext_html contain 
additionaly .tex files used in the extended HTML conversion.  See the
example documents for explanations.
