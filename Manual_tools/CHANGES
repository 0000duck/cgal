    \item[Revision: 3.11~~~Date: 2001/08/20]~\\[-3mm]
    \begin{itemize}
       \item added \verb|\ccRefPageNumAtMargin| that allows you to change the
             appearance of page numbers produced by the commands. 
             \verb|\ccRefIdfierPage| and \verb|\ccRefConceptPage|.
             If this is set to true (default), the page numbers appear at the 
             right margin with the space in between filled using 
             \verb+\ccRefPageFill+.  When false, the page numbers appear
             directly after the name using the following format ``(pg. \#)''.
       \item added command \verb|\ccRefPageBreak| that can be used to turn off
             and on page breaks that occur at the beginning and end of each
             \verb|\ccRef*| section.
       \item added \verb|\ccRequire| and \verb|\ccRequirements| commands.
             The first is like \verb|\ccPrecond| and generates a comment 
             heading with text ``Requirement''. The second generates a 
             boldface heading like \verb|\ccDefinition| with the text 
             ``Requirements''.
       \item added command \verb|\listofrefpages|, analogous to the
             \verb|\listoffigures| command, which produces a listing of
             all refernece pages in the PostScript manual.  The listing 
             can be made alphabetical using the Unix \verb|sort| command.
       \item added commands \verb|\ccMultiplePartsToc| and 
             \verb|\ccNumberChaptersByPart|
             to allow manuals with separate parts.  The first tells the
             HTML converter that its table of contents should be formatted
             properly for a manual with multiple parts and the second
             tells both HTML and \LaTeX to start numbering chapters at
             1 with each new part.
    \end{itemize}

    \item[Revision: 3.10~~~Date: 2001/04/02]~\\[-3mm]
    \begin{itemize}
       \item added the command \verb|\ccRefines| that creates a new
             heading for a class
       \item added the commands \verb|\ccHtmlNoRefLinks|
             and \verb|\ccHtmlNoRefIndex| that turn off, respectively,
             linking and indexing of reference page identifiers.
       \item added command \verb|\ccRefPageFill|, which is the command used
             by \verb|\ccRefIdfierPage| and \verb|\ccRefConceptPage| to fill 
             the space between a reference page identifier name and
             the page number (default is \verb|\dotfill|).
       \item fixed bug in HTML converter that duplicated the local scopes
             given in the headings of reference pages in the prefixes of
             nested types, {\em etc.}
       \item fixed bug that caused operators to disappear in the
             PostScript manual when \verb|ccTagOperatorLayout| was set to false.
    \end{itemize}
    % ----------------------------------------------------
    \item[Revision: 3.9~~~Date: 2000/09/01]~\\[-3mm]
    \begin{itemize}
       \item added commands \verb|\ccHtmlLinksOff|, \verb|\ccHtmlLinksOn|,
             and \verb|\ccHtmlNoLinksFrom| that allow one to cause links not 
             to be created in the HTML manual for the text delimited by 
             these commands.
    \end{itemize}
    % ----------------------------------------------------
    \item[Revision: 3.8~~~Date: 2000/08/02]~\\[-3mm]
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Fixed bug in \verb|\ccRefConceptPage| for HTML conversion
        \item Fixed bug in HTML converter that did not attach the local scope
              to reference page labels, files, {\em etc.}
        \item Fixed HTML converter so it does not generate file names 
              containing $<$, $>$ or $:$ (which Microsoft doesn't like).
    \end{itemize}
    % ----------------------------------------------------
    \item[Revision: 3.7~~~Date: 2000/07/31]~\\[-3mm]
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Fixed bugs in {\tt cc\_manual\_index.sty} causing problems with
              modified items and concepts as subitems.
        \item Fixed bug in {\tt ccInclude} macro in {\tt latex\_converter.sty} 
              that caused the item following such a command not to be linked
              when include files were not linked.
        \item Changed the tabs for the new manual style so they are now in 
              color.
        \item Changed {\tt ccAdvanced} envrionment brackets to include the
              word "advanced". 
        \item Added environments {\tt ccRefConstant}, 
              {\tt ccRefFunctionObjectConcept}, and 
              {\tt ccRefFunctionObjectClass}. 
        \item Added heading commands \verb|\ccGeneralizes| and 
              \verb|\ccQueryFunctions|.
        \item Added \verb|\ccRefConceptPage| command to be used instead of
              \verb|\ccRefIdfierPage| for concepts so the font for the concepts
              is correct.
        \item Added commands \verb|\ccSaveThreeColumns|, 
              \verb|\ccRestoreThreeColumns|, \verb|\ccSaveTwoColumns|,
              and \verb|\ccRestoreTwoColumns| that save and restore column
              widths for help in temporarily changing formatting.
    \end{itemize}
    % ----------------------------------------------------
    \item[Revision: 3.6~~~Date: 2000/05/17]~\\[-3mm]
    \begin{itemize}
       \item  Modified \verb|cc_extract_html| so it now uses the environment
              variable \verb|LATEX_CONV_INPUTS| to search for input files.
              This is analogous to the \verb|TEXINPUTS| environment variable
              used by \LaTeX.  If 
              \verb|LATEX_CONV_INPUTS| is set, files are searched for in the
              indicated directories in the indicated order; if not set, files
              are searched for in the current directory.
       \item  Modified the indexing and fromatting commands for \LaTeX, so
              now underscores are allowed in concept names but no other 
              ``special'' characters.  Concept names are displayed in the 
              default font in both the body and the index. (Note: This
              is true only for the PostScript manual; in the HTML manual,
              concept names are still displayed in italics.)
       \item  Changed test suite and {\tt cc\_check} script so they do
              not assume the current directory is in your path.
       \item  Fixed a bug in \verb|cc_manual.sty| that was placing the global
              scope string ({\em e.g.} ``CGAL::'') before concept names in page 
              headers.
       \item  Fixed a bug in \verb|cc_manual_index.sty| for index entries 
              produced by the \verb|\ccRef...| environments that were not
              formatted using \verb|\ccFont| when the optional scope argument
              was used.
       \item  Made \verb|cc_manual.sty| include the package \verb|graphicx| if
              the new manual style is used, since this is where the 
              \verb|\includegraphics| command that is used to include the side 
              tabs for the reference pages is defined.
       \item  Made \verb|cc_manual_index.sty| include the \verb|makeindex| 
              package.
       \item  Added the do-nothing command \verb|\printindex| to 
              the HTML version of \verb|latex.sty|.
       \item  Added a \verb|\cc_manual_index.sty| file to the HTML style files.
              This simply defines all the indexing commands that might appear
              in the text, but they currently do nothing.
    \end{itemize}


    % ----------------------------------------------------
    \item[Revision: 3.5~~~Date: 2000/01/27]~\\[3mm]
    %
    The following bugs and problems are remedied with this release:
    \begin{itemize}
       \item In the \verb|\parseText| macro of \verb|cc_manual_index.sty| the
             variable \verb|\text| was renamed to \verb|\indexText| to avoid
             a conflict with the existing AMS-\LaTeX\ \verb|\text| command.
       \item In \verb|cc_extract_html| (in \verb|cpp_formatting.C|), fixed a 
             formatting problem that left off the template parameters from 
             nested types and typedefs in the HTML index.
       \item Added missing command \verb|\galia| to HTML \verb|cc_manual.sty| 
             file.
       \item Added a new style file {\tt nonlinkedpath.sty} in the release.
             This file defines the command \verb|\nonlinkedpath|, which
             behaves the same as the \verb|\path| command, except it 
             does not create a link in the HTML manual. 
       \item Modified {\tt cc\_manual.sty} to include the 
             {\tt cc\_manual\_index.sty} and {\tt alltt.sty} style files upon 
             which it depends.  Similarly modified {\tt cc\_manual\_index.sty} 
             to include {\tt cc\_manual.sty} since it uses commands defined 
             there.
       \item Fixed a problem with the figure and table environments for
             the {\tt latex.sty} file that caused problems when optional
             arguments indicating placement preferences were used.
       \item Changed the names of the HTML files created to remove the
             special characters (such as \verb|<| and \verb|>|) that are 
             not supported under Microsoft windows.
       \item Updated the documentation of {\tt cc\_manual.sty} and 
             {\tt cc\_manual\_index.sty} to include
             appendices that summarize all commands and to fix a few
             inconsistencies with the style files.
    \end{itemize}

    % ----------------------------------------------------
    \item[Revision: 3.4~~~Date: 1999/09/27]~\\[3mm]
    %
    Added new \LaTeX\ style file \verb|cc_manual_index.sty| that contains
    macros for producing an index for the PostScript version of the manual.  
    This style file is documented separately.
    The style file \verb|cc_manual.sty| has been modified to allow for
    automatic indexing of most of the \CC\ names that are formatted with the
    macros in this style file.

    % ----------------------------------------------------
    \item[Revision: 3.3~~~Date: 1999/09/07]~\\[3mm]
    %
    Updated documentation and a new example directory showing the new
    style of reference manual pages. The documentation is split into
    three manuals. The documentation could still be enhanced for the 
    \LaTeX\ to HTML converter. A few bug fixes and some heavy cleanups 
    are done in the source code and other distributed files. The old
    slides are no longer distributed. Maintenance for \cgal\ is taken
    over by Susan Hert.

    % ----------------------------------------------------
    \item[Revision: 3.2~~~Date: 1999/08/24]~\\[3mm]
    %
    HTML converter and \verb+cc_manual.sty+ support the new manual 
    reference manual style (incl.~tabs at the side margins) and
    the style for the intermediate transition period. Several bugs 
    have been fixed. The documentation lacks all the new features 
    and will be updated for the next release.

    % ----------------------------------------------------
    \item[Revision: 3.1~~~Date: 1998/08/05]~\\[3mm]
    %
    Major rewrite of the HTML converter. New features: Full support of
    \LaTeX\ macro definitions with newcommand/newenvironment/newtheorem
    including parameters and a mechanism for optional parameter support.
    Support for \TeX-style macro definitions, except where pattern
    matching is used. Better support for math symbols. All symbols listed
    in the Leslie Lamport book are available. If not directly supported in
    HTML, they are included as inline GIF images. In addition
    \verb+\mathcal+ and \verb+\mathbb+ are supported with uppercase letters.
    Font style changes are fully supported including font size changes and
    small caps font shape (small caps may produce unpredictable results 
    if other non-trivial macros are used within a small caps text).
    Only limited table and formula support. No figure or PostScript
    picture support.

    Further extensions of the converter can be provided with style files,
    quite similar to \LaTeX-style files.

    The installation procedure has changed in favor of a single Makefile and
    support of environment variables, which allows the installation of future
    releases without configuring the Makefile and several scripts again and
    again.


    % ----------------------------------------------------
    \item[Revision: 2.16~~~Date: 1998/07/24]~\\[3mm]
    %
    Major rewrite of the HTML converter. This is the beta release of the
    upcoming 3.1 \LaTeX\ converter.

    % ----------------------------------------------------
    \item[Revision: 2.15~~~Date: 1998/04/08]~\\[3mm]
    %
    Removal of own class name fixed, such that it gets not removed
    if it is only a part of a larger idfier.

    % ----------------------------------------------------
    \item[Revision: 2.14~~~Date: 1998/04/01]~\\[3mm]
    %
    New macro \verb+\ccHtmlNoClassToc+ introduced.

    % ----------------------------------------------------
    \item[Revision: 2.13~~~Date: 1998/03/19]~\\[3mm]
    %
    Bug in {\tt cc\_manual.sty} with template declarations fixed. 
    Parentheses removed from bibliography keys for HTML conversion.

    % ----------------------------------------------------
    \item[Revision: 2.12~~~Date: 1998/03/06]~\\[3mm]
    %
    Minor extensions and modifications: New macro \verb+\ccIncludeVerbatim+.
    The \TeX\ capacity error has been removed in the context of certain
    template function declarations.  HTML conversion enhanced, for example
    $\sqrt[k]{n}$ converts to something like root$_k(n)$. Wider format in HTML.

    % ----------------------------------------------------
    \item[Revision: 2.11a~~~Date: 1998/02/05]~\\[3mm]
    %
    Bug fix for the HTML converter. New release 2.12 of {\tt
    cc\_extract\_html}.

    % ----------------------------------------------------
    \item[Revision: 2.11~~~Date: 1997/12/19]~\\[3mm]
    %
    Minor extensions and modifications. New subsection \verb+\ccSeeAlso+.

    % ----------------------------------------------------
    \item[Revision: 2.10~~~Date: 1997/09/13]~\\[3mm]
    %
    The LEDA page dimension settings has been commented out. They were
    responsible for the faulty behavior of the \verb+\begin{verbatim}+
    environment where the space had no longer fixed size. The
    \ccc{operator()} and the type conversion operator are now correctly
    formatted when using \verb+\ccTagFullDeclarations+.  A \verb+\label+
    was automatically defined by the \verb+\ccSection+ macro. This has
    been removed. The new \verb+\ccChapterRelease+ macro with the
    corresponding \verb+\ccTagChapterRelease+ flag works like
    \verb+\ccChapterAuthor+. Both are switched off by default now.
    \verb+\ccNestedClass+ can be used in the global scope.

    Better configuration options are provided for the HTML conversion.
    The macros \verb+\ccHtmlNoLinks+ and \verb+\ccHtmlNoClassLinks+
    suppress the automatic generation of index entries.


    % ----------------------------------------------------
    \item[Revision: 2.9~~~Date: 1997/06/19]~\\[3mm]
    %
    A macro \verb+\stl+ for \stl\ has been added. A bug fix for the
    footnote placement in the HTML converter. It could have happened that
    footnotes appeared in wrong files and that the hyper-links to them
    failed.

    % ----------------------------------------------------
    \item[Revision: 2.8~~~Date: 1997/05/27]~\\[3mm]
    %
    The \verb+\ccEmptyParameter+ has been replaced by the
    \verb+\ccClassTemplateName+ in cases where necessary. Small extensions
    and a couple of bug fixes for the HTML support, including:
    \verb+\ref{}+ handling more robust. \verb+\ccc{}+ in math mode
    allowed. \verb+\ccHtmlNoClassIndex+ also inhibits member declarations
    from writing index entries. Single letter classes are no longer
    automatically cross linked. Math spacing like \verb+\;+ works again. Line
    numbers in error messages corrected. 

    % ----------------------------------------------------
    \item[Revision: 2.7~~~Date: 1997/05/08]~\\[3mm]
    %
    Major extensions for the {\tt HTML} support. The mechanisms around the
    class environments are more flexible and can be used separately (file
    creation, indexing, cross linking), see
    Section~\ref{sectionHTMLsupport}. The {\tt HTML} converter supports
    now an additional file model for the manual with multiple
    subdirectories to avoid name clashes of class filenames and the cross
    referencing, see~\cite{k-lhcll-99}. The support for
    the automatic bibliography generation uses now the {\tt *.aux} file
    from \LaTeX\ to get the proper labels for the citation tags. The
    \verb+ccInclude+ macro converts to an anchor pointing to the actual
    header file. The \LaTeX\ style file {\tt path.sty} is supported
    with the \verb+\path+ macro to format URL's.


    % ----------------------------------------------------
    \item[Revision: 2.5~~~Date: 1997/04/24]~\\[3mm]
    %
    Bug fix for {\tt cc\_manual.sty}. The \verb+ccHtmlOnly+ environment
    failed. The \verb+\ccPrecond+ and \verb+\ccPostcond+ macros 
    sometimes did not format in a separate line as they should. Long class
    names caused the \verb+\ccNestedClass+ macro to forget the type name.

    New section titles to structure a manual page. A new \verb+\ccInclude+
    macro and a script \verb+cc_extract_include+ extracting it. An
    environment \verb+ccAdvanced+ to mark paragraphs of advanced material.
    New method to glue multiple declarations together with
    \verb+\ccGlueBegin+ and \verb+\ccGlueEnd+.


    % ----------------------------------------------------
    \item[Revision: 2.4~~~Date: 1997/03/25]~\\[3mm]
    %
    Bug fix for {\tt cc\_manual.sty}. The keyword \verb+\end+ from \LaTeX\ 
    environments might have caused trouble with the {\tt cc\_manual.sty}
    internal parsing technique. Operators were not able to format argument
    lists with extra parentheses like for function pointer types.

    A few new abbreviations for often used macros: \verb+\ccc+
    for \verb+\ccStyle+, \verb+\ccThree+ for \verb+\ccSetThreeColumns+,
    \verb+\ccTwo+ for \verb+\ccSetTwoColumns+, \verb+\ccThreeToTwo+ for
    \verb+\ccPropagateThreeToTwoColumns+, and \verb+\ccGlue+ for
    \verb+\ccGlueDeclarations+.


    % ----------------------------------------------------
    \item[Revision: 2.3~~~Date: 1997/02/19]~\\[3mm]
    %
    Bug fix for {\tt cc\_manual.sty}. The removal of the class name in
    function argument lists failed with template classes (the template
    argument remained).  Member template constructors had not worked. No
    new manual release.

    % ----------------------------------------------------
    \item[Revision: 2.2~~~Date: 1997/02/16]~\\[3mm]
    %
    The default has changed that the style is no longer compatible with
    the revision 1.14. This can be  easily changed back. In the style file
    \verb+cc_manual.sty+ is a  macro \verb+\ccPortability+ in the first
    lines. It must be set to the value \verb+\ccTrue+ to activate the old
    names again. However, the supporting tools cannot support the old
    names. See below for scripts to help in renaming old
    files.\ccIndexEntry{Portability} 

    The style has been extended with the \verb+\ccChapterSubTitle+ and 
    \verb+\RCSdefDate+ macro. The handling of template declarations is
    made more flexible with the \verb+\ccTagTemplateInline+ and
    \verb+\ccTagRmTemplate+ tags. Small changes in the layout were made.

    The tools have been purified. A bug in the dynamic memory management
    of \verb+cc_extract+ and \verb+cc_build_checker+ has been removed. The
    {\tt cc\_manual\_to\_html} script uses now the {\tt CC} environment
    variable for the C compiler.

    The \verb+cc_manual_to_html+ converter handles now user defined macros
    (without parameters) and footnotes.

    % ----------------------------------------------------
    \item[Revision: 2.1~~~Date: 1997/01/22]~\\[3mm]
    %
    Major new release. If you still have to upgrade old documentations
    from revision 1.14 based on {\tt cgal\_manual.sty}, a \Dindex{Perl 
    script}\index{scripts, Perl} helps in upgrading: 
    {\tt cc\_update\_2.1} renames all of the older 
    macros.\index{renaming macros}
