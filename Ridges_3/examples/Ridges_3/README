Program blind.exe
-----------------
takes an filename.off file as input,
it computes a jet fitting to set the monge data at each vertex 
computes the ridge lines

it outputs the results in :
1. filename.off.4ogl.txt  which can be visualized with 
	the demo program visu.exe
2. if option -v, filename.off.verb.txt contains human readable results

Usage is : blind  with options    
    "f:fName <string>",	 // filename.off
    "d:deg <int>",	 // degree of the jet fitting must be >=3, default is 4
    "m:mdegree <int>",	 // degree of the Monge rep must be >=3, default is 4
    "a:nrings <int>",	 // # rings 
			0 means collect enough rings to make appro possible
			k>=1 fixes the nb of rings to be collected
    "p:npoints <int>",   //# points
			0 means this option is not considered, this is the default
			n>=1 fixes the nb of points to be used
    "v|",                // verbose?
 
Note : if the nb of collected points is less than the required min number of 
   points to make the approxiamtion possible (which is constrained by the deg)
   then the vertex is skipped.
