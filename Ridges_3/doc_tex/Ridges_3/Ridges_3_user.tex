This chapter describes the \cgal's package for the extraction of
ridges and umbilics on meshes.  Given a smooth surface, a ridge is a
curve along which one of the principal curvatures has an extremum
along its curvature line. An umbilic is a point at which both
principal curvatures are equal. Umbilics are special points on the
ridge lines. Ridges are curves of {\em extremal} curvature and
therefore encode important informations used in segmentation,
registration, matching and surface analysis.  Based on the results of
the article
\cite{rr}, we propose several algorithms to identify and extract
different parts of this singular ridge curve as well as umbilics on a
surface given as a triangular mesh.

\subsection{Ridges and umbilics of a smooth surface}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A comprehensive description of ridges can be found in
\cite{hgyg-ttdpf-99,ip-gd-01}, and in the sequel, we just
introduce the basic notions so as to explain our algorithms.
Consider a smooth embedded surface, and denote $k_1$ and $k_2$ the
principal curvatures, with $k_1\geq k_2$. Umbilics are the points
where $k_1=k_2$.  For any non umbilical point, the corresponding
principal directions of curvature are well defined, and we denote them
$d_1$ and $d_2$. 
%%
Anything related to the maximal (minimal) curvature is qualified blue
(red), for example we shall speak of the blue curvature for $k_1$ or
the red direction for $d_2$.
%%
In local coordinates, we denote $\langle , \rangle$
the inner product induced by the ambient Euclidean space, and $dk_1$,
$dk_2$ the gradients of the principal curvatures. Ridges, illustrated
on Figs \ref{pict:ellipsoid_ridges} and \ref{fig:ridges_ellipsoid},
are defined by:
%%
\begin{definition}
\label{def:ridge-extrema}
A non umbilical point is called
\begin{itemize}
\item
%a blue ridge point if $\langle dk_1,d_1 \rangle=0$,
a blue ridge point if the {\em extremality coefficient} $b_0=\langle
dk_1,d_1 \rangle$ vanishes, i.e. $b_0=0$.

\item
%a red ridge point if $\langle dk_2,d_2 \rangle=0$.
a red ridge point if the {\em extremality coefficient} $b_3=\langle
dk_2,d_2 \rangle$ vanishes, i.e. $b_3=0$.

\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
%We denote $b_0=\langle dk_1,d_1 \rangle$ and $b_3=\langle dk_2,d_2
%\rangle$, and we call these functions the {\em extremality
%coefficients}. 
%%
The previous characterization of ridges involves third-order
differential properties. Using fourth-order differential quantities, a
ridge point can further be qualified as {\em elliptic} if it
corresponds to a maximum of $k_1$ or a minimum of $k_2$, or {\em
hyperbolic} otherwise. Hence we end with four types of ridges, namely
: \ccc{BLUE_ELLIPTIC_RIDGE}, \ccc{BLUE_HYPERBOLIC_RIDGE}, \ccc{RED_ELLIPTIC_RIDGE},
\ccc{RED_HYPERBOLIC_RIDGE}.
In addition, a subset of elliptic ridges, called the crest lines,
which can be seen as the visually most salient curves on a surface are
also of interest. A crest line is an elliptic ridge which is a maximum
of $\max(|k_1|,|k_2|)$. Hence we provide two additional ridge types :
\ccc{BLUE_CREST} and \ccc{RED_CREST}.

Weigths are associated to each line
\begin{itemize}
\item
the {\bf strength} which is the integral of the curvature along the
line.
\item
the {\bf sharpness} which is the integral of the absolute value of
the second derivative of the curvature along the ridge.
\end{itemize}
