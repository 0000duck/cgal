\chapter{Search Structures} \label{Trees}

\section{Introduction}

This chapter presents the {\cgal} range tree, segment tree, and $KD$-tree 
data structures. 
The range tree is theoretically superior to the $KD$-tree, but the 
latter often seems to perform better.
However, the range tree as implemented in {\cgal} is more flexible than the
$KD$-tree implementation, in that it enables to layer together range trees 
and segment trees in the same data structure.

First the range and segment trees are introduced in 
sections~\ref{s-rangesegment} through~\ref{general}.
Then the $KD$-tree is presented in Sections~\ref{KDT_chapter} through
\ref{KDT_sec:req:interface}.
