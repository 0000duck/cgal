\begin{ccRefClass}{Pm_file_writer<Planar_map>}

\ccCreationVariable{pm_file_writer}

\ccDefinition
The \ccRefName\ class is inherited from the \ccc{File_header} class. 
This class contains functions for writing the \ccc{Planar map} components to a given output stream.
The user has to make sure that methods for writing {\em Point} and {\em X\_curve} types of \ccc{Planar_map} are defined in the output stream he chooses to work with.
This class is templated with \ccc{Planar map}, and hence the user can work with \ccRefName\ with its own \ccc{Planar map}. 
 
%The following requirement catalog lists the primitives, i.e., types, member functions
%etc., that must be defined for any \ccc{Planar map} file writer class that can be used to parameterize the reading function of \ccc{Planar map}. 

\ccTypes

The following handles and iterators have appropriate constant counterparts. The mutable types are assignable to their
constant counterparts. The iterators are assignable to the respective handle types. 
Wherever the handles appear in function parameter lists, the appropriate iterator can be used as well. 

\ccNestedType{Vertex_handle}{handle to the \ccc{Planar map} vertex.}
\ccNestedType{Halfedge_handle}{handle to the \ccc{Planar map} halfedge.}
\ccNestedType{Face_handle}{handle to the \ccc{Planar map} face}.
\ccNestedType{Vertex_iterator}{a bidirectional iterator over the vertices of the \ccc{Planar map}.}
\ccNestedType{Halfedge_iterator}{a bidirectional iterator over the halfedges of the \ccc{Planar map}.}
\ccNestedType{Face_iterator}{a bidirectional iterator over the faces of the \ccc{Planar map}.}

\ccCreation
As described in the introduction, the planar map users can choose a verbose format for printing their \ccc{Planar map}, this is done by putting this option in the constructor.

\ccConstructor{Pm_file_writer(std::ostream& o, const PM& pm, bool verbose = false);} 
{constructs \ccRefName\ for a given output stream, the specified \ccc{Planar map} and a verbose choice.}

\ccConstructor{Pm_file_writer(std::ostream& o, const PM& pm, const File_header& h)} 
{constructs \ccRefName\ for a given output stream, the specified \ccc{Planar map} and a file header.}

\ccOperations

In the following operations the methods for writing lines in comments are defined only if the comments flag is set to true:

\ccMethod{void write_title (const char *feature_name); }
{writing a title (in comments) to the output stream.}

\ccMethod{void write_pm_vhf_sizes ();}
{writing the number of vertices, halfedges and faces in the \ccc{Planar map} to the output stream.}

\ccMethod{void write_vertices_header ();}
{writing a title (in comments) that begins the vertices list to the output stream.}

\ccMethod{void write_halfedges_header ();}
{writing a title (in comments) that begins the halfedges list to the output stream.}

\ccMethod{void write_faces_header ();}
{writing a title (in comments) that begins the faces list to the output stream.}

\ccMethod{void write_comment (const char *str);}
{writing a line by comments with the information noted in {\em str} to the output stream.}

\ccMethod{void write_comment (const char *str, int i);}
{writing a line by comments with the information noted in {\em str} and {\em i} to the output stream.}

\ccMethod{void write_value (unsigned int val, 
                            char deliminator = newline);}
{writing an integer value followed by a deliminator to the output stream.
 the delimiter has a default value set to the newline character 
 '$\backslash$n'.}

\ccMethod{ostream& out();}
{return the output stream the \ccc{Planar map} is written to.} 

\ccMethod{void write_vertex (Vertex_handle v);}{writing a vertex of the \ccc{Planar map} to the output stream.}
\ccMethod{void write_halfedge (Halfedge_handle h);}{writing an halfedge of the \ccc{Planar map} to the output stream.}
\ccMethod{void write_face (Face_handle f);}{writing a face of the \ccc{Planar map} to the output stream.}

\ccMethod{void write_vertices (Vertex_iterator Vertices_begin, Vertex_iterator Vertices_end);}{writing all the vertices in the range [Vertices\_begin, Vertices\_end) to the output stream.}

\ccMethod{void write_halfedges (Halfedge_const_iterator Halfedges_begin, Halfedge_const_iterator Halfedges_end);}
{writing all the halfedges in the range [Halfedges\_begin, Halfedges\_end) to the output stream.}

\ccMethod{void write_faces (Face_iterator Faces_begin, Face_iterator Faces_end);}
{writing all the faces in the range [Faces\_begin, Faces\_end) to the output stream.}
