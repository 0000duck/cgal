  g++-2.8.1 internal compiler bug.
- Changes in Trapezoidal_map_2.C to reduce statics.

2.02:
====
-changes in Pm_default_dcel.h and Topological_map - for compilation
on Sun

2.0:
=====================================================
- A totally new design based on the polyhedron design - 
  three levels - Dcel,Topological map, Planar map, with
  a handle based interface (iterators as models of handles).
- Fast point location based on a trapezoidal map search
  structure.
- A strategy pattern enabling the user to choose between
  the fast point location algorithm or the naive one, or design her
  own point location algorithm.
- Addition of the remove_edge and merge_edge functions.
- Change in the IO (now in the file <CGAL/IO/Pm_iostream.h> -
  not final yet (therefore not documented)
- Changes and additions supporting the above in the test,example
  and demo.

CGAL-1.1:
#########

1.12:
========================================================
-changed specification and implementation so that halfedge_around_vertex
circulators return the halfedges pointing _at_ (not from) the vertex.
This conforms with the convention in the Halfedge_data_structure chapter.
-changes in the epsilon traits enable to define the epsilon by using 
template parameters (by default it is 1/10000). 

CGAL-1.0:
#########

1.11c:
=========================================================
-changes to make egcs-1.0.2 happy

1.11b:

future)

-fix in example3

1.11:
===========================================================
- adjustments to egcs/g++2.80 (adding typename etc.)
- name changes made in cgal (double.h instead of Double.h etc.)
- the demo program was changed so it is now without
  dependenceon the triangulation package
