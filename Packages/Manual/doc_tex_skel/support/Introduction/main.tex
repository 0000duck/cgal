\input{common_intro}

This part of the reference manual covers the support library. This library
currently contains facilities to support number types, STL extensions for 
\cgal, handles, circulators, protected access to internal representations, 
geometric object generators, timers, I/O stream operators and other stream 
support including PostScript, colors, windows, and visualization tools 
GeoWin and Geomview.

\begin{ccAdvanced}
Some functionality of a number of classes and algorithms is considered more
advanced, for example because integrity of the underlying data structure
is not guaranteed.
In such cases the programmer is responsible for integrity.
These functionalities are described in sections like this one, bounded by
horizontal brackets.
