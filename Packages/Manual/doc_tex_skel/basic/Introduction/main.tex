\input{common_intro}

This part of the reference manual covers the basic library.
The collection of basic geometric algorithms and data structures
currently includes polygons, half-edge data structures, polyhedral surfaces, 
topological maps, planar maps, arrangements of curves, triangulations, 
convex hulls, alpha shapes, optimisation algorithms, dynamic
point sets for geometric queries, and multidimensional search trees.
