Installation of the Manual package
========================================================================

In order to be able to create CGAL's manuals you need to do the following:

(1)  install the manual conversion tools (available as package Manual_tools 
     on the CVS server or from http://www.cgal.org/Members/Manual_tools)

(2)  make the cgal_manual script in 'developer_scripts/' accessible via 
     the standard execution path.

     Additional scripts in 'developer_scripts/', such as  bibmerge (which you 
     probably won't need to use), can be Perl scripts where you need to edit
     the first line to indicate the proper location of your Perl installation.


Follow the directions in the Developers Manual to create a manual.
