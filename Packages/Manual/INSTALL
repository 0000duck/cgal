Installing the manual package
========================================================================

In order to be able to use the scripts in the scripts/ directory to
create a manual, you need to do the following:

(1)  install the manual conversion tools (available as package Tools or
     from http://www.cgal.org/Members/Tools)

(2)  most of the scripts are shell scripts, which assume sh to be located in
     /bin/sh.  If this is not the case(!), edit the scripts to indicate the 
     proper location.  The scripts bibmerge and rmbibcomments (which you 
     probably won't need to use) are Perl scripts and should also be edited
     to indicate the proper location of your Perl installation.

(3)  make the scripts in scripts/ accessible via the standard execution path.
     as well as the ps2pdf program (used in scripts/to_pdf).  

(4) Set the following environment variables:
      BIBINPUTS           should include the path of geom.bib
      TEXINPUTS           should include the path of cc_manual.sty, 
                          cc_manual_index.sty, etc.
      LATEX_CONV_CONFIG   should be set the location of config files
                          for HTML conversion
      LATEX_CONV_BIN      should be set to the location of bin files for
                          for HTML conversion

(5) Edit the following lines in the doc_tex_skel/makefile as necessary to 
    indicate the correct destination of the results

      TEST_DESTINATION=/www/pub/www.cgal.org/Members/Manual_test
      TEST_SUBDIR=test_manual
      DESTINATION=/www/pub/www.cgal.org/Manual
      DOC_PS_DESTINATION=$(DESTINATION)
      DOC_PDF_DESTINATION=$(DESTINATION)
      DOC_HTML_DESTINATION=$(DESTINATION)
      DOC_DOWNLOAD_DIR=/ftp/pub/outgoing/CGAL

(6) Edit these lines in doc_tex_skel/makefile to indicate the correct source 
    for frame set and include files needed when creating a final release 
    manual: 

      HTML_FRAME_SOURCE=/KM/usr3/cgal/web_pages/Manual
      INCLUDE_SOURCE=/KM/usr3/cgal/releases/CGAL-2.3/

(7) In the file scripts/install_manual_files, edit the following line as 
    necessary to indicate the source of the doc_tex directory

    SOURCE_DIR="/KM/projects/CGAL/Work_in_Progress/CGAL_autotest/$VERSION"

(8) In the file scripts/autotest_cgal_manual, edit the following lines
       CGAL_MANUAL_TEST_DIR="/KM/usr3/cgal/manual"
       MANUAL_TEST_URL="http://www.cgal.org/Members/Manual_test/${CGAL_RELEASE_ID}.manual_test.html"

(9) Edit the following line in scripts/to_pdf 

      DISTILL="/opt/adobe/AcroDist_2.1/bin/distill"

    to indicate the proper location of your local distill installation.


Follow the directions in the README file in this directory to create a manual.
