Manual/TO_DO
==================

-- enum is in the index linked to
   http://www.cgal.org/Manual/doc_html/cgal_manual/Polyhedron_ref/Class_Polyhedron_incremental_builder_3.html#Enum_enum
   and there linked to a 404 page.

-- Fix ccTagOperatorLayout in Kernel_23

-- Fix: "area" to doc page /CGAL::area. /This is wrong because the widget 
   drawing area it is not related to CGAL::area.
   The same for the combination Meta "Object" Compiler that points to 
   CGAL::Object.

-- Add -v flag to print commands executed (helps in doing it later by hand)

-- Add -debug flag that prevent temp file from being deleted (debug index)

-- Look into Naming conventions "User Manual" of the OpenGL books

-- generate a pdf manual which does not have left and right pages.

-- Have Installation as separate manual

-- Remove Use of STL manual

-- Document and maybe improve cgal_manual on how to release the 
   manuals, i.e., mainly how to pack them properly with subdirs
   see ./makefile

-- Would it be possible to replace the requirement that the Manual/
   directory is placed side by side with the package we want to build the
   doc, by an environment variable (which could default to "../..") ?

-- debug option to keep all temp files

-- letter option for letter size paper in PS

-- alternative for creating PDF (some options seem to be missing for 
   good font support though, -ups, -Ppdf???)

   dvips -t letter -o pdf_wrapper.ps pdf_wrapper
   ps2pdf pdf_wrapper.ps
