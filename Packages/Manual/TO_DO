Bug Fixes
============================================================================

-- MAN: Remove the explicit \ccRefPageBegin/End's from my manual pages
   since they are automatically called in the refPage environment [small]


Feature Requests
============================================================================

-- TeX: Change page numbers of printed manual to <Part-Num>-<Chapter-Num> 
   + page per chapter. It simplifies packaging of individual manuals. 
   Try just to redefine \thepage. It might not work as smooth as expected 
   with the indexing and would turn thus into a project, not a feature 
   request. Seek consensus on cgal-develop/cgal-editor for such change.

-- TeX, HTML: header/footer are not respected yet. The printed manuals
   have no footer like the HTML manuals yet. Can be added to the wrapper 
   file embodied into cgal_manual.

-- SRC: Add -v flag to cgal_manual to print commands executed 
   (helps in doing it later by hand)

-- SRC: Add -debug flag to cgal_manual that prevent temp file from 
   being deleted (debug index)

-- CHECK: Look into Naming conventions. e.g., "User Manual" of the OpenGL books

-- TeX: generate a PostScript and PDF manuals for single sided printers, 
   i.e., which do not distinguish between left and right pages. Things
   to check: alignment with paper boundaries, header and footer, and 
   the "Class", "Concept", etc., tabs should all be on the right side.
   Suggestion: make this an option of cgal_manual, but the default
   remains double sided, since almost all users will have double sided
   printers these days. We also have to figure out whether we want to 
   support all combinations of A4 and letter size paper with single or
   double sided printing on the download page, or if this is an option
   for Andreas GeometryFactory only to offer cumstomized manuals for
   his customers.

-- DOC: Remove Use of STL manual

-- SRC: Would it be possible to replace the requirement that the Manual/
   directory is placed side by side with the package we want to build the
   doc, by an environment variable (which could default to "../..") ?
   (name it CGAL_MANUAL_DIR, define it to end with .../Manual/ )


Projects
============================================================================

-- CHECK: Check what to do with  Tutorial/doc_tex, needs reorganization
   to be intergrated into the automatic manual test build. The tutorials
   should be build and tested as all other manuals too.

-- SRC: either adapt cgal_manual, or create a new script that works on the
   latest test suite result, and builds a release candidate of the manuals,
   in particular, repackages the files into their proper subdirectories 
   before tar'ing. (Check the current release for file organization.)

-- SRC: How to support US letter paper at the same time as A4 in PS and PDF?

-- CHECK: alternative for creating PDF (some options seem to be missing for 
   good font support though, -ups, -Ppdf???)
   ???: dvips -t letter -o pdf_wrapper.ps pdf_wrapper
   ???: ps2pdf pdf_wrapper.ps
