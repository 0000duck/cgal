Bug Fixes
============================================================================

-- MAN: Remove the explicit \ccRefPageBegin/End's from my manual pages
   since they are automatically called in the refPage environment [small]


Feature Requests
============================================================================

-- TeX: Change page numbers of printed manual to <Part-Num>-<Chapter-Num> 
   + page per chapter. It simplifies packaging of individual manuals. 
   Try just to redefine \thepage. It might not work as smooth as expected 
   with the indexing and would turn thus into a project, not a feature 
   request. Seek consensus on cgal-develop/cgal-editor for such change.

-- TeX, HTML: header/footer are not respected yet. The printed manuals
   have no footer like the HTML manuals yet. Can be added to the wrapper 
   file embodied into cgal_manual.

-- SRC: Add -v flag to cgal_manual to print commands executed 
   (helps in doing it later by hand)

-- SRC: Add -debug flag to cgal_manual that prevent temp file from 
   being deleted (debug index)

-- CHECK: Look into Naming conventions. e.g., "User Manual" of the OpenGL books

-- PDF: generate a pdf manual which does not have left and right pages.
   (Andreas Fabri requested that, but I don't know exactly where the problem
   is.)

-- DOC: Remove Use of STL manual

-- SRC: Would it be possible to replace the requirement that the Manual/
   directory is placed side by side with the package we want to build the
   doc, by an environment variable (which could default to "../..") ?
   (name it CGAL_MANUAL_DIR, define it to end with .../Manual/ )


Projects
============================================================================

-- CHECK: Check what to do with  Tutorial/doc_tex, needs reorganization
   to be intergrated into the automatic manual test build. The tutorials
   should be build and tested as all other manuals too.

-- SRC: either adapt cgal_manual, or create a new script that works on the
   latest test suite result, and builds a release candidate of the manuals,
   in particular, repackages the files into their proper subdirectories 
   before tar'ing. (Check the current release for file organization.)

-- SRC: How to support US letter paper at the same time as A4 in PS and PDF?

-- CHECK: alternative for creating PDF (some options seem to be missing for 
   good font support though, -ups, -Ppdf???)
   ???: dvips -t letter -o pdf_wrapper.ps pdf_wrapper
   ???: ps2pdf pdf_wrapper.ps
