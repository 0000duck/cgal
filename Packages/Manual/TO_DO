Manual/TO_DO
==================

-- Document and maybe improve cgal_manual on how to release the 
   manuals, i.e., mainly how to pack them properly with subdirs
   see ./makefile

-- Would it be possible to replace the requirement that the Manual/
   directory is placed side by side with the package we want to build the
   doc, by an environment variable (which could default to "../..") ?

-- debug option to keep all temp files

-- letter option for letter size paper in PS

-- alternative for creating PDF (some options seem to be missing for 
   good font support though, -ups, -Ppdf???)

   dvips -t letter -o pdf_wrapper.ps pdf_wrapper
   ps2pdf pdf_wrapper.ps
