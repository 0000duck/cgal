Ver 4.1 (25 August 1999)
readded file CGAL/IO/triangulation_Window_stream.h for backward compatibility.
Debugged the example "Triangulation with colored faces" of the manual.
Add this example (colored_face.C) in examples/Triangulation.

Ver 4.0 (18 August 1999)
A new version of triangulation based on a new version of 
the triangulation data structure with a more coherent representation 
of degenerate 0-dimensional and 1-dimensional triangulations.
From the user point of view this new version should mostly
achieved backward compatibility. The main changes concern the iterators
on the faces, edges and vertices of the triangulation. 
They now come with two flavours : the "Finite" iterators iterate only on finite 
features while the "All" iterators iterate on all (finite or infinite) features
of the triangulation. Old iterator types and functions are still present for
backward compatibility.

Ver 3.25 (5 August 1999)
Make a few modifications required by MIPSPRO 7.3 :
added a few typedefs in derived class
added using std in testsuite 

Ver 3.24 (9 July 1999)

Triangulation_euclidian_traits_xz_3.h 
Triangulation_euclidian_traits_yz_3.h 

Ver 3.8 (1 Mai 99)
fixed some bugs related to MIPS CC after CGAL Meeting in Zurich

Ver 3.7 (18 April 99)
fixed a small bug related to g++ 2.8.1 (std:: versus CGAL_STD)

Ver 3.6 (14 April 99)
fixed a bug
Make the testsuite run with g++ 2.8.1.
However the problen of compare() is not quite settled.
The test suite runs with g++ 2.8.1 because it uses either
a special test_traits which does not use compare()
or the euclidean traits with gmpz arithmetic.
The examples do not run because they use euclidean traits with  double
and then the clash of compare() appears

Ver 3.5 (9 April 99)
namespaces introduced in examples and demos

Ver 3.4 (8 april 99)
reactiveated the short names for egcs compiler. No more problems with long names
did not correct the bug with  CGAL_triangulation_assertion (see previous)

Ver 3.3 (31 March 99)

(had to comment a line CGAL_triangulation_assertion(false) in a subclass
Remains a problem with longnames 
#define is not convenient with namespaces
The bug in circumcenter has been fixed (a problem of number type)

Ver 3.2 (27 March 99)
A few bugs related to namespace corrected
Class Triangulation_line_face_circulator is no longer a subclass of Triangulation
It remains a bug to be fixed in circumcenter....

Ver 3.1 (March 99, the 11th)
Fixed bugs related to namespaces

Ver 3.0 (Feb 99) intoduction of namespaces  and new header files

Ver 2.10 (Janv. 99)
Corrected a few details.

Ver 2.9 (Jan 99)
Corrected a few small details related to
warning "unused variable ..." when compiling without preconditions
ans warning "possibly uninitialised variable" when compiling with -O2

Ver 2.8 (Dec 98)
Added #include CGAL/Triangulation_short_names_2.h
to some files where it was missing to make it hidden from the user
Fixed a bug related with default parameter and the previous move
of function definitions.

Ver 2.7 (Dec 98)
Change the implementation of cw() and ccw().

Ver 2.6 (Dec 98)
Change the names of some (dummy) template parameter in Constrained Triangulation
to make test_suite compile with CC
Put the definition of complicated function outside class definition
to prevent them from being inlined.

Ver 2.5 (Dec 98)
Change template parameters because CC does not support typename in parameter type declaration.
Changed cgal_test to suppress the test of test_constrained_triangulation_2.C
which does not compile on CC

Ver 2.4 (Nov 98)
Added some test for constrained Triangulations
Fixed a few bugs in the test suite.

Ver 2.1 (Oct 98)
Added some missing header files.
Fixed a small bug in increment decrement operators of Line_face_circulator
Added a demo for triangulations and Delaunay triangulations and examples.
There is still no demo, nor examples, nor testsuite
for constrained and regular triangulations
(to come soon). 
The dual functions (asking for Voronoi dual) dont work with the terrain traits class
(CGAL_Triangulation_euclidean_traits_xy_3) and the like.

Ver 2.0 (Sep 1998)
A new version of the triangulation package.
The triangulation  classes are now implemented along a three levels structure
analog to the scheme used in the polyhedron package and in the planar map package.

From the user point of view, the main changes reside in the following fact :
the triangulation classes (CGAL_Triangulation_2, CGAL_Delaunay_triangulation_2,
CGAL_Constrained_triangulation_2 etc.) are now templated with two parameters
(a geometric traits class and triangulation data structure class).

The test_suite concerns only the classes CGAL_Triangulation_2 and CGAL_Delaunay_triangulation_2.
The other triangulation classes CGAL_Regular_triangulation_2 and CGAL_Constrained_triangulation_2
have not yet been thoroughly tested.



Ver 1.23 (Jul 1998)
- removed warning (count not used) in example/Triangulation/example.C
- removed pointer chapter from the documentation
- added include <CGAL/IO/File_writer_OFF.h> in triangulation_print_OFF.h
- added examples to the documentation and to the demo subdirectory

Ver 1.22 (Jul 1998)
- examples/points: added compare to Euclidean_2, and fixed CGAL_orientationC2
- Eliminated some warnings in Triangulation_2.h(1968)::clear(), and
  Triangulation_face_iterator.h(150)

  in euclidean_traits_*_3 [due to a change in C2 package]
- changed ==(Point,Point) to traits().compare(Point,Point)
  This is due to the comparison of points not being the same as
  the == operator, e.g. for Euclidean_traits_3 (== checks x,y,z
  coordinates, but triangulation expects only x and y)
- re-added copy constructor to CGAL_Pointer

Ver 1.19 (19 Jun 1998)

- corrected bug in Face::remove()
- added types Line, Ray, Direction to traits classes
- added copy constructor to CGAL_Pointer
- moved back test/ExamplesTriangulation into examples/Triangulation
- fixed examples so that they return 0 (and the test suite works)
- added demo/ to package
- added Inventor_stream.h into demos, so that points3D can compile
- added two demos (voronoi and crust)

- moved doc_tex/basic/* into doc_tex/basic/Triangulation (for Geert-Jan's
  scripts)
- edited documentation

Ver 1.15 (26 Feb 1998)
- fixed the _xy euclidean traits classes and tst27, tst37
- removed the input in examples, so that they can be run in the testsuite

Ver 1.14 (25 Feb 1998)
- introduced separation between demo and examples 
- fixed the examples

Ver 1.13 (17 Feb 1998)
- added operator<<(..., Constrained_Triangulation ...)
- added documentation in the new format (doc_tex/basic)
- added documentation in html format (doc_html/basic/Triangulation)

- modified CGAL_CFG_ flags
- added typenames, CGAL_NULL_TEMPLATE_ARGS, and other compiler helps
- added leda_color (for LEDA-3.6)
- corrected a few bugs and fixed the test suite
- straightened for g++ 2.8.0
- There still is a bug with Constrained_triangulation, we're working on it.
  For now, we release the code, the documentation, and the examples, but it
  is not yet in the test suite.

Ver  1.11 (19 Dec 1997)
- CGAL_Pointer<>::pointer() renamed to ptr() to avoid name clash with
     typedef T* CGAL_Bidirectional_circulator_base<T,.,.>::pointer
- Handles introduced in class Triangulation_2
- class Triangulation_2, Delaunay_triangulation_2
- traits classes Euclidean_traits_2, Euclidean_traits_xy_3, yz_3, and xz_3
