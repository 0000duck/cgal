\ccDefinition
  
A constrained triangulation is a triangulation of a set of points
which has to include among its edges 
a given set of segments joining the points. The corresponding 
edges are called {\em constrained edges}. 

The set of points defining the vertices of the triangulation
includes the set of constrained edges endpoints. It may include other points
(considered as null length constrained edges) as well.  The set of
constrained edges forms a set of segments which do not intersect
except possibly at their endpoints.  Any number of constrained edges
are allowed to share the same endpoint.  Vertical constrained edges or
constrained edges with null length are allowed.

The class \ccRefName\ of the CGAL library
implements constrained triangulations.
The template parameters \ccc{Traits} and \ccc{Tds}
are to be instantiated with models of respectively
\ccc{Triangulation_traits_2}  and
\ccc{Triangulation_data_structure_2}.
 The information about constrained edges is store in the 
faces of the triangulation. Thus the nested \ccc{Face}
type of a constrained triangulation offers
additonnal functionalities to deal with this information.
Within the design of a triangulation data structure
models templated by the base face class and the base vertex class,
these additional functionalities related to the constraints
are requirements which have to be fulfilled
by the base face.
The base face of a constrained triangulation
has to be a model of the concept
\ccc{Constrained_triangulation_face_base_2}.

The only new type defined by
\ccRefName\ is a constraint type: a
constraint is represented as a pair of points.

\ccCreation
\ccCreationVariable{ct}  %% choose variable name
The creators of the class build the constrained triangulation from a
list of constrained edges. Constrained edges are assumed to have no
intersection other than endpoints. Any number of constrained edges are
allowed to share the same endpoint.  Vertical constrained edges or
constrained edges with null length are allowed.

\ccConstructor{Constrained_triangulation_2();}{default constructor.}
\ccConstructor{Constrained_triangulation_2(const
Constrained_triangulation_2& ct1)}
 {Copy constructor, all faces and vertices
are duplicated and  the constrained status of edges
is copied. This last feature is not yet implemented.}

\ccConstructor{Constrained_triangulation_2(list<Constrained>& lc,
const Traits& t = Traits());}
{Introduces a constrained triangulation, the constrained edges of which
are the edges of the list \ccc{lc}.}

                               const Traits& t=Traits());}
{A templated constructor which introduces and builds
 a constrained triangulation with constrained edges in the range 
$\left[\right.$\ccc{first}, \ccc{last}$\left.\right)$.
\ccPrecond The \ccc{value_type} of \ccc{first} and \ccc{last}

{ Inserts points a and b, and inserts segment ab as a

\ccHeading{Implementation}

The constructors build the triangulation using a sweeping line
algorithm. The complexity of this algorithm is $O(n\log n)$ if $n$
endpoints are present. The sweep structure is an \stl\ map.
 The insertion of a constrained edge runs in time
proportionnal to the number of triangles intersected by this edge.

There is no need for a special implementation
of the method \ccVar\ccc{.is_valid()}
because the base class function
\ccc{ Triangulation_2<Traits>::is_valid()}
call the face class method
\ccc{Tds::Face::is_valid()} 
which, in the case of a constrained triangulation,
includes a test of the consistency of the
information about constrained edges.
