\chapter{Handles} 

Most of the data structures and classes of the \cgal library
uses the concept of \ccc{Handle} in their user interface.
The concept \ccc{Handle} describes what is    often called 
a trivial iterator.  
A \ccc{Handle} is
mainly   a pointer to an object providing 
dereference operator \ccc{operator*()} and 
member access \ccc{operator->()} but no increment or decrement 
operators.
A  \ccc{Handle} should be used whenever the referenced
object
is not part of a logical sequence.
