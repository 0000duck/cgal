DEMOS   :
---------

demo:
Illustrates features of the  basic triangulation and of Delaunay Triangulation
(i. e. the classes CGAL_Triangulation_2<Gt,Tds> and
CGAL_Delaunay_triangulation_2<Gt,Tds>)
It makes use of graphical IO and needs LEDA to be installed.

regular_demo
a demo for regular triangulations

constrained
A demo for the constrained triangulation.
The constraints are read from a file and the constrained Delaunay triangulation is build. 
When clicking left, a point is input and the connected component containing
this point is shown.
You can try several points. Click right to terminate.
