1.7 (8 March 2001)

    Added typedefs for Traits parameters in Partitioned_polygon_2.

    rearranged class declarations in Partitioned_polygon_2.h to please VC++
    and fixed other small bugs with const vs. non-const interators, typedefs
    for class not public.

    Changed name of Polygon_2 template parameter to Polygon in some functions
    so VC++ won't get confused with the Polygon_2 class defined elsewhere.
    

1.6 (19 January 2001)

    Fixed more problems with types and typedefs in Partitioned_polygon_2.

    Fixed small problem with introduction to reference pages in doc.
   
1.5 (8 January 2001)
   
    Moved definitions of template functions in other classes to see if 
    Borland and VC++ can deal with this better and fixed some typedefs
    causing problems with these two compilers.

    Modified documentation in accordance with suggestions from editors.

1.4 (20 November 2000)
   
    fixed bug in the cgal_test script

    Moved definitions of template functions in Indirect_edge_compare class 
    inside the class to see if Borland and VC++ can deal with this better.

1.3 (7 November 2000)
    
    changed test suite by dividing it into more programs that will take
    less time to compile and adding a compile-time flag so the same program 
    can be used for testing the homogeneous and Cartesian kernels.

    fixed(?) some bugs with template parameters for Borland

1.2 (20 September 2000)
    
    added a few missing .C files

1.1 (2 August 2000)
    
    Fixed bugs with misplaced includes for .C files, a few missing CGAL::
    for MIPS, and wrong function names in example files. 

1.0 (28 July 2000)
   
    Initial release
