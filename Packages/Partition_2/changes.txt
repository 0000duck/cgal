-------------------------------- Release 2.4 ----------------------------------

1.14 (12 July 2001)
    minor fix in doc.

1.13 (12 July 2001)
    Simplified Partition_vertex_map so it does not have any circular type
    references;  this makes the Borland compiler happy
  
    Converted Partition_vertex_map to be based on a vector instead of a list
    to make the Borland compiler happy.

    Shorted names of some predicate classes

    introduced exact number types in some examples

    changed test programs so they can use the default cgal_test now.

1.12 (6 July 2001)
    Fixed many things in documentation (requirements vs. preconditions;
    added Implementation sections; included example programs instead of
    using verbatim)

    changed example programs to use a random polygon instead of a static one

    added README for example programs

    added file name in example programs

1.11 (2 May 2001)

    Changed traits requirements for y-monotone partition to incorporate
    the Compare_x_at_y function now available in the kernel.
    
1.9 (22 March 2001)
    Changed basis for std::stack in Vertex_visibility_graph_2 to std::list
    instead of std::deque (the default) since the latter under MSVC++ assumes
    pointers where it shouldn't (i.e., iterator_traits doesn't work).

    Changed name of template parameter from Point_2 to Point_2_ in set_valid
    for Partition_opt_cvx_edge so VC++ won't get confused.

    Made some cosmetic changes to the demos.

1.8 (12 March 2001)

    Changed Vertex_const_iterator to Vertex_iterator for Partition_vertex_map
    build() function and partition_is_valid_2() in the hopes that this will 
    fix the problem the Windows compilers have with the call to insert in
    build().

    Removed the .C files that cannot be used with VC++ because of template
    member functions.

    Fixed some warnings related to unused variables and parameters.

1.7 (8 March 2001)

    Added typedefs for Traits parameters in Partitioned_polygon_2.

    rearranged class declarations in Partitioned_polygon_2.h to please VC++
    and fixed other small bugs with const vs. non-const interators, typedefs
    for class not public.

    Changed name of Polygon_2 template parameter to Polygon in some functions
    so VC++ won't get confused with the Polygon_2 class defined elsewhere.
    

1.6 (19 January 2001)

    Fixed more problems with types and typedefs in Partitioned_polygon_2.

    Fixed small problem with introduction to reference pages in doc.
   
1.5 (8 January 2001)
   
    Moved definitions of template functions inside classes to see if 
    Borland and VC++ can deal with this better and fixed some typedefs
    causing problems with these two compilers.

    Modified documentation in accordance with suggestions from editors.

1.4 (20 November 2000)
   
    fixed bug in the cgal_test script

    Moved definitions of template functions in Indirect_edge_compare class 
    inside the class to see if Borland and VC++ can deal with this better.

1.3 (7 November 2000)
    
    changed test suite by dividing it into more programs that will take
    less time to compile and adding a compile-time flag so the same program 
    can be used for testing the homogeneous and Cartesian kernels.

    fixed(?) some bugs with template parameters for Borland

1.2 (20 September 2000)
    
    added a few missing .C files

1.1 (2 August 2000)
    
    Fixed bugs with misplaced includes for .C files, a few missing CGAL::
    for MIPS, and wrong function names in example files.

    Initial release
