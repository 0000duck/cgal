Version 1.1.18 (27-Sep-2003)
- new headers

Version 1.1.17 (17-Jun-2003)
- \ccFont -> \ccc

Changes from version 1.0 to 1.1:
- We no longer support "dynamic" dimension: That is, from now on the
  dimension is a template argument and must thus be known in advance.
- Support for float has been added.  (Formerly, double was the only
  supported floating-point type.)
