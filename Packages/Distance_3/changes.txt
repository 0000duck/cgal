- bug fix in include/CGAL/squared_distance_3_0.h

2.11 (11 September 2003)
- Replaced begin()/end() of segment and ray with source()/target()
- Replaced subtraction of points with functor Construct_vector_3

2.10 (10 September 2003)
- Added specializations for Cartesian and homogeneous kernels [af]

2.9 (04 September 2003) [af]
- Simplified template parameter. As side effect we avoid an ICE of SunPro CC 5.4

2.8 (12 August 2003)
- Bug fix in squared_distance_3_0.h [af]

2.7 (7 August 2003) [mh,af]
A first step towards the extendible Kernel:

* All functionality is moved into namespace CGALi, in namespace CGAL
  there remain forward functions for the geometric types from the CGAL
  kernel thereby fully maintaining backwards compatibility; nothing
  changes on the user level.

* In the CGALi part, all types are referred to as K::Type rather than
  Type<K>.

* In the CGALi part, all functions have a kernel object as last
  argument, not only to ease the matching (no explicit template
  argument needed), but also to be able to handle kernels with state.

2.6 (4 April 2003)
- Did the changes in 2.5.5 in the web files instead of the header files

2.5.5 (25 February 2003)
- Generalize wcross() to work with Filtered_kernel<> and other.

2.5.3 (9 November 2001)
+ Fixed two bugs: divisions were done on ring types instead of field types.

2.5.2 (19 February 2001)
+ Fixed bug in wdot in squared_distance_3_0.

2.5 (14 February 2001)
+ Added flags for the SIMPLE kernels.
+ Rewrote wdot in terms of wmult.

2.4.5 (19 June 2000)
+ Qualified call to 'abs' and 'sign' by CGAL_NTS

-----
* 2.4.4 *
+ added -b switch to diff program
+ removed include file guards

-----
* 2.4.3 *
+ cgal_test writes diff of output and expected output to ProgramOutput,
  instead of complete output.

-----
* 2.4.2 *
+cgal_test now writes to ProgramOutput* file

-----
* 2.4.1 *
+Small change in test/cgal_test

-----
* 2.4 *
+Replaced R_FT_return and R_RT_return macros
+Avoided forward declarations of functions returning R::FT, as this caused
 a bug under MSVC. This causes the disappearance of several .C files.

-----
* 2.3 *
Added some CGAL_ prefixes to inclusion guards

-----
* 2.2 *
Moved some functions from squared_distance_3_0.C to squared_distance_3_0.h

-----
* 2.1.2 *
Adapted cgal_test and makefile in test directory to windows compatible
install_cgal script.
