\section{Introduction}
Snap Rounding (SR, for short) is a well known method for converting
arbitrary-precision arrangements of segments into a fixed-precision
representation \cite{gght-srlse-97, gm-rad-98, h-psifp-99}. In
the study of robust geometric computing, it can be classified
as a finite precision approximation technique. Iterated Snap Rounding
(ISR, for short) is a modification of SR in which each vertex is at least
half-the-width-of-a-pixel away from any non-incident edge
\cite{cgal:hp-isr-02}. This package supports both methods. Algorithmic
details and experimental results are given in \cite{cgal:hp-isr-02}.

\section{What is Snap Rounding/Iterated Snap Rounding}
Given a finite collection $\S$ of segments in the plane, the
arrangement of $\S$ denoted $\A(\S)$ is the subdivision of the plane
into vertices, edges, and faces induced by $\S$. %\cite{arrg-surveys}.
A {\it vertex\/} of the arrangement is either a segment endpoint or
the intersection of two segments. Given an arrangement of segments
whose vertices are represented with arbitrary-precision coordinates,
the SR procedure
\ccc{snap_rounding_2<Traits,InputIterator,OutputContainer>}
proceeds as follows. We tile the plane
with a grid of unit squares, {\it pixels}, each centered at a point
with integer coordinates. A pixel is {\it hot\/} if it contains a
vertex of the arrangement. Each vertex of the arrangement is replaced
by the center of the hot pixel containing it and each edge $e$ is
replaced by the polygonal chain through the centers of the hot pixels
met by $e$, in the same order as they are met by $e$. 
Figure~\ref{fig:sr1} demonstrates the results of SR.

In a snap-rounded arrangement, the distance between a vertex and
a non-incident edge can be extremely small compared with the width of a
pixel in the grid used for rounding. ISR
is a modification of SR which makes a vertex and a
non-incident edge well separated (the distance between each is at least
half-the-width-of-a-pixel). However, the guaranteed quality of the
approximation in ISR degrades. Figure~\ref{fig:isr_vs_sr} depicts
the results of SR and ISR on the same input.
Conceptually, the ISR procedure is equivalent to repeated application
of SR, namely we apply SR to the original set of segments, then we use
the output of SR as input to another round of SR and so on until all the
vertices are well separated from non-incident edges. Algorithmically
we operate differently, as this repeated application of SR would have
resulted in an efficient overall process. The algorithmic details are
given in \cite{cgal:hp-isr-02}.

\section{Terms and Software Design}

Our package supports both schemes, implementing the algorithm
described in \cite{cgal:hp-isr-02}.
Although the paper only describes an algorithm for ISR,
it is easy to derive an algorithm for SR, by performing only
the first rounding level for each segment.
%Theoretical bounds for the algorithm
%are $O(n\log n +I+L^{2/3}N^{2/3+\varepsilon}+L)$
%time for any $\varepsilon>0$ and $O(n+N+L^{2/3}N^{2/3+\varepsilon})$ working
%storage , where $I$ is the number of intersection points, $N$ is the number of
%hot pixels (which is at most $2n+I$) and $L$ is the overall number of links in
%the chains produced by the algorithm. The analysis assumes the use of
%partition trees as a search structure with which we answer segment/pixel
%intersection queries. Since it is difficult to implement, we used a data
%structure consisting of several kd-trees instead. Hence, the above bounds
%degrade but nor significantly.

% new addition, Danny 14/4/04:
The input to the program is a set $S$ of $n$ segments,
$S=\{s_1,\ldots,s_n\}$ and the output is a set $G$ of $n$ polylines,
with a polyline $g_i$ for each input segments $s_i$. An input segment
is given by the coordinates of its endpoints. An output polyline is
given by the ordered set of vertices $v_0,\ldots,v_k$ along the polyline.
The polyline consists of the segments $\bar{v_0v_1},\ldots,\bar{v_{k-1}v_k}$.

There are three template parameters: \ccc{Traits} is the underlying geometry,
i.e., the number type used and the coordinate representation.
\ccc{InputIterator} is the type of the iterators that point to the first
and after-the-last elements of the input. Finally, \ccc{OutputContainer} is the
type of the output container.

Since the algorithm requires kernel functionalities such as the rounding to the
center of a pixel, a special traits class must be provided. The precise
description of the requirements is given by the concept
\ccc{SnapRoundingTraits_2}. The class \ccc{Snap_rounding_traits_2} is a model of
this concept.

\section{Four Line Segment Example}

The following example generates an ISR representation
of an arrangement of four line segments. In particular it produces
a list of points that are the vertices of the resulting polylines in a plane
tiled with one-unit square pixels.

\ccIncludeExampleCode{Snap_rounding_2/example1.C}
% +--------------------------------------------------------+

This program generates four polylines, one for each input segment. The exact
output follows:

\begin{verbatim}
Polyline number 1:
    (0/4:0/4)
    (12/4:12/4)
    (20/4:20/4)
    (28/4:28/4)
    (40/4:40/4)
Polyline number 2:
    (0/4:40/4)
    (12/4:28/4)
    (20/4:20/4)
    (28/4:12/4)
    (40/4:0/4)
Polyline number 3:
    (12/4:0/4)
    (12/4:12/4)
    (12/4:28/4)
    (12/4:40/4)
Polyline number 4:
    (28/4:0/4)
    (28/4:12/4)
    (28/4:28/4)
    (28/4:40/4)
\end{verbatim}

The package is supplied with a graphical demo program that opens a window,
allows the user to edit segments dynamically, applies a selected
snap-rounding procedures, and displays the result onto the same window
(see \ccStyle{<CGAL_ROOT>/demo/Snap_rounding_2/demo.C}).
