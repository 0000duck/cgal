\section{Introduction}
Snap rounding is a well known method for converting
arbitrary-precision arrangements of segments into a fixed-precision
representation. It is classified as a finite precision approximation 
technique. This package makes Snap Rounding of line segments in $\reals_2$.
It is based on the paper 'Snap Rounding Revisited' which provides a modification
to Snap Rounding named Iterated Snap Rounding. This package provides both
Iterated Snap Rounding and the usual Snap Rounding which is a private case.
For details we refer you to the article.

\section{What is Snap Rounding/Iterated Snap Rounding}
Given a finite collection $\S$ of segments in the plane, the
arrangement of $\S$ denoted $\A(\S)$ is the subdivision of the plane
into vertices, edges, and faces induced by $\S$. %\cite{arrg-surveys}.
A {\it vertex\/} of the arrangement is either a segment endpoint or
the intersection of two segments. Given an arrangement of segments
whose vertices are represented with arbitrary-precision coordinates,
snap rounding (SR, for short) proceeds as follows.  We tile the plane
with a grid of unit squares, {\it pixels}, each centered at a point
with integer coordinates. A pixel is {\it hot\/} if it contains a
vertex of the arrangement. Each vertex of the arrangement is replaced
by the center of the hot pixel containing it and each edge $e$ is
replaced by the polygonal chain through the centers of the hot pixels
met by $e$, in the same order as they are met by $e$.

Since in a snap-rounded arrangement, the distance between a vertex and
a non-incident edge can be extremely small compared with the width of a
pixel in the grid used for rounding, this package provides, beside the
usual Snap Rounding, a modification of it, named Iterated Snap Rounding,
which makes the a vertex and a non-incident edge well separated.

The following example generates a snap rounding representation of an arrangement of four line segments
and a list of points which are the vertices of the resulting polylines.
