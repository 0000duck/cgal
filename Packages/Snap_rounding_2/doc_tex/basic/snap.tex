\section{Introduction}
Snap rounding is a well known method for converting
arbitrary-precision arrangements of segments into a fixed-precision
representation \cite{gght-srlse-97, gm-rad-98, h-psifp-99}. It is classified as a finite precision approximation 
technique. Iterated Snap Rounding is a modification of Snap Rounding in
which each vertex is at leat half-the-width-of-a-pixel away from any
non-incident edge \cite{isr-2002}.
This package provides supports both methods.

\section{What is Snap Rounding/Iterated Snap Rounding}
Given a finite collection $\S$ of segments in the plane, the
arrangement of $\S$ denoted $\A(\S)$ is the subdivision of the plane
into vertices, edges, and faces induced by $\S$. %\cite{arrg-surveys}.
A {\it vertex\/} of the arrangement is either a segment endpoint or
the intersection of two segments. Given an arrangement of segments
whose vertices are represented with arbitrary-precision coordinates,
snap rounding (SR, for short) proceeds as follows.  We tile the plane
with a grid of unit squares, {\it pixels}, each centered at a point
with integer coordinates. A pixel is {\it hot\/} if it contains a
vertex of the arrangement. Each vertex of the arrangement is replaced
by the center of the hot pixel containing it and each edge $e$ is
replaced by the polygonal chain through the centers of the hot pixels
met by $e$, in the same order as they are met by $e$. 
Figure~\ref{fig:sr1} demonstrates a snap rounding output. 

In a snap-rounded arrangement, the distance between a vertex and
a non-incident edge can be extremely small compared with the width of a
pixel in the grid used for rounding. Iterated Snap Rounding is a modification
of Snap Rounding which makes the a vertex and a non-incident edge well separated
(the distance between each is at least half-the-width-of-a-pixel).
However, the guaranteed quality of the approximation in Iterated Snap Rounding
degrades. Figure~\ref{fig:isr_vs_sr} demonstrates the differences between Iterated
Snap Rounding and Snap Rounding.

The following example generates an Iterated Snap Rounding representation
of an arrangement of four line segments
and a list of points which are the vertices of the resulting polylines.
