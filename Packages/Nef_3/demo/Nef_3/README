demo/Nef_3/README
=================

The visualization of these demo programs only work with QT and OpenGL. 
If you have Qt and OpenGL install, but GL.h and GLU.h are not found,
see http://doc.trolltech.com/3.3/opengl.html.

nef_3:  This program maintains a stack of Nef_3 polyhedra and accepts
------  a little language to manipulate this stack, load files, apply
        boolean operations, save files, etc.

visualization_SM: This program shows how to display the sphere map of 
----------------  a vertex in an Nef_polyhedron_3. The program expects
                  a 3D Nef polyherdon from standard in. For example
		  call ./visualization_SM < visualization_SM.cin


visualization_SNC: This program shows how to display Nef_polyhedron_3. 
                   The program expects a 3D Nef polyhedron from
		   standard in. For example call
		   ./visualization_SNC < visualization_SNC.cin
