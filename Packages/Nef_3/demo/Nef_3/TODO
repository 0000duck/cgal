  - CGAL::Nef_polyhedron_3::transform is not complete yet
    (I seem to miss some geometry that needs to be transformed too,
     e.g. Sphere_circle and end-points in Sphere_segment ?)
    Would be nice to make './nef_3 loadoff cube.off trans 1 1 1 1' work.

  - An 'is_valid(bool verbose = false, int level = 0)' member function 
    would be nice for debugging and assertions. I would suggest to
    have something to test consistent pointers and geometry, and another
    function to test in addition that it is a Nef_3 SNC complex (i.e. it is
    simplified). Combined they form the is_valid() test.

  - More commands, e.g.:
      - 'include <filename>' reads <filename>, breaks it into words at 
        whitespaces and calls 'eval( argc, argv)' recursively 
      - 'empty' and 'full' that create the empty space and the full space
      - 'halfspace <coefficients>' once we can handle halfspaces with infboxes

  - The call to visualize never returns. That is inherent to the 'glut'
    toolkit used. One way around could be to create a second process
    (with fork or similar) that starts glut's main event loop. The 
    first process then waits for the second process to stop (maybe
    optional, that would allow in a demo to open several windows at once).
