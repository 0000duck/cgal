The implementation represents Nef polyhedra following the Reduced
Wuerzburg Structure as local neighborhood of the minimal elements
in the incidence relation and a global structure, called Selective
Nef Complex (SNC), encoding the incidence relation between the 
local neighborhoods.
   We use an infimaximal box to bound all infinite elements and
obtain thus only vertices as minimal elements in the incidence relation.
The local neighborhood of vertices is represented as sphere maps (SM),
an embedding of 2D Nef polygons on the sphere.
   The global structure links the local Sphere Maps together with 
oriented edges, oriented facets with boundary cycles that consist 
of oriented edge-uses, shells that are edge-use connected facet 
components, and volumes that are bounded by shells. Each element 
is marked whether it belongs to the selected point set or not.
