- Fix protected classes included in Nef_polyhedron_3.h from SNC_structure.h
- Fix new compilation errors on SNC_OGL_visualizor.h when using gcc 3.0.4
- Synthesizing volumes from SM representation
- Simplification of the SNC structure
- Simplify during the construction from polyhedral surfaces
  (based on the simplification of SM)
- Unary operations
