Nef_3 Package: TODO
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- Simplification of the SNC structure
- Simplify during the construction from polyhedral surfaces
  (based on the simplification of SM)
- Unary operations
- Intersections of Line_3 with Line_3
- Find all intersections between two SNC's.
- Binary operations
- Extended kernel with infimaximal box
- Define endpoint of segments used for ray shoting to be in the 
  infimaximal box.
