- renamed Degeneracy_testers.h Validity_testers.h
- removed the macro USE_FINITE_EDGES; the conceptual change: infinite Voronoi
  edges and halfedges (which are the duals of infinite Delaunay edges) are no
  longer reported as edges or halfedges.
- redesigned the degeneracy testers/traits to provide regular predicate
  functors instead of constructive predicate functors
- removed file Projector_classes.h: classes in there are no longer necessary
- added copyright headers
- updated doc according to new design of Voronoi traits and its predicate
- added reference doc for the various Voronoi traits classes
