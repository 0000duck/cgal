- changes in the doc:
  * fixed some open issues in the various models of the Voronoi traits concept.
  * added concepts for halfedges, vertices, faces of the Voronoi diagram.
  * added concepts for Voronoi edges and vertices, seen as geometric objects.
  * extended the VoronoiTraits_2 concept to incorporate geometric objects,
    such as Voronoi vertices and edges.
  * fixed Voronoi_diagram_adaptor_2 doc to make references to appropriate
    concepts and also fixed return types of various iterators/circuclator (in
    compliance with the arrangements'API).
- changes in the code:
  * changed return type for Halfedge_around_vertex_circulator and
    Ccb_halfedge_circulator to be Halfedge instead of Halfedge_handle.
  * changed return type of Holes_iterator from Halfedge_handle to
    Ccb_halfedge_circulator.
  * added methods point() in Vertex and curve() in Halfedge; added the
    corresponding support in the Voronoi traits classes and created the
    appropriate base classes for representing Voronoi vertices and edges (seen
    now as geometric objects).
  * Voronoi_diagram_adaptor_2 class: removed predicate methods to simplify the
    interface; these methods were simply shortcuts to other calls, accessible
    publicly to the user.
  * the Voronoi_diagram_adaptor_2 class now uses the cached testers by default;
    however the interface is not very very clean since the edge_tester() and
    face_tester() methods are still public.
  * removed definition of Edge_hash_function in the
    Cached_edge_degeneracy_tester since it was identical to that in
    CGAL/edge_list.h; the definition in CGAL/edge_list.h is now used.
- changes in testsuite:
  * updated Delaunay_graph_concept and Voronoi_traits_concept classes in order
    to comply with the recent changes.
  * the vda_*.C testsuites are now using the normal traits classes and not
    the cached traits classes.
  * updated the concept checking method in include/vda_test_concept.h to test
    for recently added types
  * updated vda_print_report.h w.r.t. changes referring to eliminated predicate
    methods in Voronoi_diagram_adaptor_2; also added tests for the geometric
    objects returned by Vertex and Halfedge (point() and curve() respectively.
- other changes:
  * added example that computes the number of connected components of the
    Voronoi skeleton.

- changed the return type of the circulators to be Halfedge instead of
  Halfedge_handle.
- changed the return type of Holes_iterator from Halfedge_handle to
  Ccb_halfedge_circulator.

22 May 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- re-wrote the face degeneracy testers so that they do not need the edge
  degeneracy tester as an argument. This simplifies both the code and the
  concepts.
- fixed wrong names of types in the Voronoi_diagram_adaptor_2 class and
  dependent classes

21 May 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- renamed Degeneracy_testers.h Validity_testers.h
- removed the macro USE_FINITE_EDGES; the conceptual change: infinite Voronoi
  edges and halfedges (which are the duals of infinite Delaunay edges) are no
  longer reported as edges or halfedges.
- redesigned the degeneracy testers/traits to provide regular predicate
  functors instead of constructive predicate functors
- removed file Projector_classes.h: classes in there are no longer necessary
- added copyright headers
- updated doc according to new design of Voronoi traits and its predicate
- added reference doc for the various Voronoi traits classes

- added types and methods to reach conformity with the concepts
