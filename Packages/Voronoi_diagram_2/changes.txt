- removed duplicate typedef in Virtual_Voronoi_diagram_base_2 class;
  g++ version 4.x.x was complaining.

20 July 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- demo: added halfedge classes that derive from the halfedge class of the
  adaptor, that are used for drawing to Qt_widget
- code:
  * removed the Voronoi_edge_2 and Voronoi_vertex_2 classes from the
    Voronoi traits; their functionality has been moved in the halfedge and
    vertex classes of the adaptor.
  * added first attempt for implementation of identity Voronoi traits
- testing: removed testing for Voronoi_edge_2 and Voronoi_vertex_2 concepts;
  added testing for the corresponding functionality added in Halfedge and
  Vertex.

17 July 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- in various doc files renamed:

  * Dual_graph to Delaunay_graph
  * Dual_face_handle to Delaunay_face_handle
  * Dual_edge to Delaunay_edge
  * Dual_vertex_handle to Delaunay_vertex_handle
- the halfedges, vertices and faces of the Voronoi diagram as well as the
  corresponding handles are now models of LessThanComparable
- the dual feature of halfedges, vertices and faces is now accessed through
  a method called simply dual().
- removed references to holes in both doc and code
- removed example connected_components.C; point location example now uses the
  Delaunay triangulation.
- added demo files

16 July 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas

- made Dual_* types in the adaptor private
- renamed DelaunayGraphPointLocator_2 concept to DelaunayGraphNearestSite_2
- renamed DelaunayGraphLocateResult_2 concept to
  DelaunayGraphNearestSiteQueryResult_2

- added some predicate methods in Halfedge that already existed in
  VoronoiEdge_2
- added some support for the incremental construction of the diagram
- added output operators towards the Qt_widget for the various Voronoi edges
- replaced Voronoi_diagram_adaptor_2.h by Voronoi_diagram_2.h

26 June 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas

  adaptor; changed test suite and doc to reflect this change
- renamed Locate_type to Locate_result.
- renamed VoronoiDiagramLocateType_2 to VoronoiDiagramLocateResult_2.
- renamed DelaunayGraphLocateType_2 to DelaunayGraphLocateResult_2.
- made Locate_result convertible to vertex handle, face handle, halfedge

  respectively.

25 June 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
Manual:
- added user manual
- added bounded faces iterator, unbounded/bounded halfedges iterator
  in VDA interface
- added more comments in examples
- modified VoronoiDiagram{Halfedge,Vertex,Face}_2 concepts; the concepts are
  no longer refinements of the planar map or topological map corresponding
  concepts, but rather stand alone; as a result I had to add all needed types
  and methods.
- modified the VoronoiEdge_2 concept: the Point_2 is no longer required
- modified the VoronoiVertex_2 concept: the Point_2 is required to be the
  Point_2 type of the geometric traits of the dual graph
Test:
- added singleton data set for regular triangulation
- collected various helper functions in single file
- added very thourough testing for the various concepts and the adaptor itself;
  much of the code in print_report has been moved to the test_vda function.
- added testing of singleton data sets
- added copyright headers
- the Delaunay_graph_concept class now uses the dummy iterator in
  include/CGAL/Voronoi_diagram_adaptor_2/Dummy_iterator.h
- added missing access methods in Delaunay_graph_concept
Examples:
- stylistic changes so that they look nice in the manual
Code:
- fixed bug in face degeneracy tester of the segment Voronoi diagram traits:
  the tester was not handling correctly the case where we have a single
  generator (i.e., when the dimension of the Delaunay graph was 0).
- added in Dummy_iterator: decrement operators,
  const_pointer/const_reference types and corresponding operators,
  operator<, access to default value
- circulators are now convertible to handles
- The base iterator in the halfedge iterator adaptor is no longer hardcoded;
  also the edge iterator adaptor takes a true/false tag that helps adapting
  how the value of the iterator is computed; all these are needed for fixes
  in the various edge iterators and for the introduction of the
  unbounded/bounded halfedge iterators
- added the class Accessor which is a friend of the Voronoi_diagram_adaptor_2
  class; this class is meant to be used as a way to access private types or
  data from the Voronoi_diagram_adaptor class.
- added testers for unbounded/bounded halfedges and bounded faces
- added code for bounded faces iterator, unbounded/bounded halfedges
  iterator
- added support for Voronoi diagrams with a single generator
- fixed minor bugs in the adaptor class

21 June 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- manual: added intro to the ref manual
- manual: added models to various concepts
- manual: changed names of some template paremeters

18 June 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- fixed the point_location example w.r.t. the changes made on June 16;
  the Locate_type classes is now used in the example as well.
- changed the spec for the face denegeracy tester: we do not require
  any more operators that take iterators or circulators as arguments; since
  iterators and circulators are convertible to handles, these operators are
  not really required. In addition this should fix the bug with the VC 7.1
  compiler.
- changed the code to reflect the change in the spec discussed above.
- introduced a Default_face_degeneracy_tester that always returns false; now
  all Voronoi traits except that of the SVD use this default tester instead
  of defining their own
- modified the cached and ref counted Voronoi traits to define the point
  locator as well
- added concepts for locate types in the doc; added usage of locate types
  in the various classes/concepts
- modified copyright headers in doc
- added the two examples in the doc

16 June 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- added some more data sets for testing with regular triangulation's point
  location
- added Locate_type classes
- the locate methods now return proper Locate_type classes instead of Object

12 June 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- added point location functionality for Delaunay triangulations, Apollonius
  graphs and segment Voronoi diagrams (in their traits).
- added point location functionality (and testing) in the Voronoi diagram
  adaptor.
- added one more example that does point location.
- added support (and testing) for 1-dimensional Delaunay graphs.
- added some more test data sets for testing point location and support
  for 1-dimensional Delaunay graphs

11 June 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- added copyright headers in some files that did not have one
- changed institution in copyright headers
- added Connected_components.h which contains a generic algorithm for
  computing the number of connected components of the Voronoi skeleton

4 June 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- in Dummy_iterator and Circulator_from_halfedge_adaptor: operator*() and
  operator->() that returned a const reference and const pointer have been
  removed (in order to avoid warnings by icc/icpc/icl and cl compilers);
  moreover, these operators are not really used.
- in *_Voronoi_traits_2 classes and in Voronoi_traits_concept class:
  icc/icpc/icl and cl compilers have a problem with the declaration of
  Voronoi_edge_base_2 as a friend when this declaration is done through the
  parent class; created a CGAL config file and added the appropriate
  #ifndef - #endif block that checks for this problem.
- fixed warning for unused variables when NDEBUG is defined
- fixed unused variable warning in Halfedge.h and vda_print_report.h

27 May 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- changes in the doc:
  * fixed some open issues in the various models of the Voronoi traits concept.
  * added concepts for halfedges, vertices, faces of the Voronoi diagram.
  * added concepts for Voronoi edges and vertices, seen as geometric objects.
  * extended the VoronoiTraits_2 concept to incorporate geometric objects,
    such as Voronoi vertices and edges.
  * fixed Voronoi_diagram_adaptor_2 doc to make references to appropriate
    concepts and also fixed return types of various iterators/circuclator (in
    compliance with the arrangements'API).
- changes in the code:
  * changed return type for Halfedge_around_vertex_circulator and
    Ccb_halfedge_circulator to be Halfedge instead of Halfedge_handle.
  * changed return type of Holes_iterator from Halfedge_handle to
    Ccb_halfedge_circulator.
  * added methods point() in Vertex and curve() in Halfedge; added the
    corresponding support in the Voronoi traits classes and created the
    appropriate base classes for representing Voronoi vertices and edges (seen
    now as geometric objects).
  * Voronoi_diagram_adaptor_2 class: removed predicate methods to simplify the
    interface; these methods were simply shortcuts to other calls, accessible
    publicly to the user.
  * the Voronoi_diagram_adaptor_2 class now uses the cached testers by default;
    however the interface is not very very clean since the edge_tester() and
    face_tester() methods are still public.
  * removed definition of Edge_hash_function in the
    Cached_edge_degeneracy_tester since it was identical to that in
    CGAL/edge_list.h; the definition in CGAL/edge_list.h is now used.
- changes in testsuite:
  * updated Delaunay_graph_concept and Voronoi_traits_concept classes in order
    to comply with the recent changes.
  * the vda_*.C testsuites are now using the normal traits classes and not
    the cached traits classes.
  * updated the concept checking method in include/vda_test_concept.h to test
    for recently added types
  * updated vda_print_report.h w.r.t. changes referring to eliminated predicate
    methods in Voronoi_diagram_adaptor_2; also added tests for the geometric
    objects returned by Vertex and Halfedge (point() and curve() respectively.
- other changes:
  * added example that computes the number of connected components of the
    Voronoi skeleton.

24 May 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- changed the return type of the circulators to be Halfedge instead of
  Halfedge_handle.
- changed the return type of Holes_iterator from Halfedge_handle to
  Ccb_halfedge_circulator.

22 May 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- re-wrote the face degeneracy testers so that they do not need the edge
  degeneracy tester as an argument. This simplifies both the code and the
  concepts.
- fixed wrong names of types in the Voronoi_diagram_adaptor_2 class and
  dependent classes

21 May 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- renamed Degeneracy_testers.h Validity_testers.h
- removed the macro USE_FINITE_EDGES; the conceptual change: infinite Voronoi
  edges and halfedges (which are the duals of infinite Delaunay edges) are no
  longer reported as edges or halfedges.
- redesigned the degeneracy testers/traits to provide regular predicate
  functors instead of constructive predicate functors
- removed file Projector_classes.h: classes in there are no longer necessary
- added copyright headers
- updated doc according to new design of Voronoi traits and its predicate
- added reference doc for the various Voronoi traits classes

19 May 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- added types and methods to reach conformity with the concepts
