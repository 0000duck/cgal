\begin{ccRefFunctionObjectConcept}{DelaunayGraphPointLocator_2}

The \ccc{DelaunayGraphPointLocator_2} concept defines the requirements
for a functor that performs point location queries on a Delaunay
graph. The functor returns an object of type \ccc{Locate_result}, which
is a model of the \ccc{DelaunayGraphLocateResult_2}
concept. Semantically, the locate result is either a face, edge or
vertex of the Delaunay graph. It is a face if the query point is
equidistant to at least three vertices of the Delaunay graph, namely
the three vertices of the returned face. It is an edge if the query
point is equidistant to exactly two vertices of the Delaunay graph,
which are the source and target vertices of the edge. In all other
cases, the locate result is a vertex, namely, the unique vertex of the
Delaunay graph closest to the query point. The
\ccc{DelaunayGraphLocateResult_2} concept, as well as the
\ccc{Locate_result} type, that is a model of the afore-mentioned concept,
encapsulate the semantics described above.

\ccTypes

In addition to the types required by the \ccc{AdaptableFunctor}
concept, a model of this concept must provide the following types:


%\ccTwo{EdgeDegeneractTester::Dual_graph+}{}
\ccTwo{DelaunayGraphLocatePointLocator_2::Locate_result+}{}
\ccNestedType{Dual_graph}{A type for the Delaunay graph. It must be
  model of the \ccc{DelaunayGraph_2} concept.}

\ccNestedType{Locate_result}{A type for the result of the point
  location. It must be a model of the \ccc{DelaunayGraphLocateResult_2}
  concept.}

%\ccCreation

%In addition to the default and copy constructors and the assignment
%operator, the following constructor must be defined:

%\ccThree{EdgeDegeneracyTester et(Dual_graph* dg)+}{}
%\ccThreeToTwo
%\ccConstructor{EdgeDegeneracyTester(Dual_graph* dg);}{A constructor
%  that is initialized by a pointer to a \ccc{Dual_graph} object.}

\ccOperations
It must also provide the following operations:

\ccThree{Locate_result}{pl(Dual_graph dg, Point_2 p)+}{}
\ccThreeToTwo
\ccMemberFunction{Locate_result operator()(Dual_graph dg, Point_2 p);}
{Returns the feature of the Delaunay graph on which the point \ccc{p}
  lies.}
