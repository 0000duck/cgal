\ccSection{Window Stream}

Note: For the functionality described in this section you need \leda.

\ccDefinition 

An object of type \ccClassName\ is a two-dimensional window for
graphical IO. The input and output operations performs a mapping from
object coordinates to window coordinates.
Actually, \ccClassName\ is identical to the \leda\ class \ccStyle{leda_window}.
Therefore, the rich functionality of \ccStyle{leda_window} is available on
\ccClassName\ as well, for example panels.
In addition, the class \ccClassName\ provides input and output 
operators for the classes which are defined in the \cgal\ kernel.
\ccClassName s should be initialized with a coordinate frame (by calling member function
\ccc{init}) and must be displayed (by calling member function \ccc{display}) before
drawing.

\ccCreation
\ccCreationVariable{W}
\ccConstructor{Window_stream();}
{creates a squared window with maximal possible edge length
(minimum of width and height of the display).}

\ccConstructor{Window_stream(const char* label);}
{creates a maximal squared window with frame label $label$.}

\ccConstructor{Window_stream(float width, float height);}
{creates a window \ccVar\ of physical size \ccStyle{width} $\times$ \ccStyle{height} pixels.}


\ccConstructor{Window_stream(float width, float height, const char* label);}
{creates a window \ccVar\ of physical size \ccStyle{width} $\times$ \ccStyle{height} pixels 
and frame label \ccc{label}.}

In addition, \ccClassName s can be created by the functions

\ccFunction{Window_stream* create_demo_window();}
{creates a window of 512 $\times$ 512 pixels, sets the window label to
CGAL, and  initializes the object space that is mapped to the physical window to
[-1.0, 1.0] $\times$ [-1.0, 1.0]. 
Returns a pointer to the window created.}

\ccFunction{Window_stream* create_and_display_demo_window();}
{creates a window of 512 $\times$ 512 pixels, sets the window label to
CGAL, initializes the object space that is mapped to the physical window to 
[-1.0, 1.0] $\times$ [-1.0, 1.0] and 
displays it at default position on the display. Returns a pointer to the window created.}

\ccFunction{Window_stream* create_demo_window( float width, float height, const char* str, double x_extension);}
{creates a window of \ccStyle{width} $\times$ \ccStyle{height} pixels, sets the window label to
\ccc{str}, and  initializes the $x$-range in object space that is mapped to the physical window by
[-\ccc{x_extension}, \ccc{x_extension}]. The $y$-range is initialized such that the origin is at
the center of the window. 
Returns a pointer to the window created.}

\ccFunction{Window_stream* create_and_display_demo_window( float width, float height, const char* str, double x_extension);}
{creates a window of \ccStyle{width} $\times$ \ccStyle{height} pixels, sets the window label to
\ccc{str}, and initializes the $x$-range in object space that is mapped to the physical window by
[-\ccc{x_extension}, \ccc{x_extension}]. The $y$-range is initialized such that the origin is at
the center of the window. The window is displayed at default position on the display. 
Returns a pointer to the window created.}

\ccOperations
A window is initialized by a part of the object space by

\ccMethod{void init(double x0, double x1, double y0); }
%{sets $xmin$ to $x_0$, $xmax$ to $x_1$, and $ymin$ to $y_0$, 
%             the scaling factor $scaling$ to $w / (xmax-xmin)$, and 
%             $ymax$ to $ymin + h \cdot scaling$. Here $w$ and $h$ are the
%             width and height of the drawing section in pixels. }
{initializes the  part of the object space that is mapped to the physical
window to [\ccc{x0},\ccc{x1}] $\times$ 
[\ccc{y0},\ccc{y0} + \ccc{height}$*$(\ccc{x1}-\ccc{x0})/\ccc{width}],
where \ccc{width} and \ccc{height} are the width and the height of the window in pixels.}

To display a window, the following functions can be used. Note that \ccc{W.display()} 
has to be called before all drawing operations on \ccc{W} and that all operations adding 
panel items to \ccc{W} have to be called before the first call of \ccc{W.display()}.

\ccMethod{void display();}
{opens \ccc{W} and displays it at the default position, i.e. 
with its right upper corner in the upper right corner of the screen.}

\ccMethod{void display(int x, int y);}
{opens \ccc{W} and displays it with its left upper corner at position
(\ccc{x},\ccc{y}).}

\ccMethod{void display(Window_stream& W0, int x, int y);}{}
\ccMethod{void display(int x, int y, Window_stream& W0);}
{opens \ccc{W} and displays it with its left upper corner at position 
(\ccc{x},\ccc{y}) relative to the upper left corner of  window \ccc{W0}.}

See the \ccAnchor{http://www.mpi-sb.mpg.de/LEDA/MANUAL/MANUAL.html}{LEDA Manual}
\cite{mnsu-lum} for further operations on \ccc{leda_window}.

\def\ccTagRmEigenClassName{\ccFalse}
\ccHeading{Output Operators}

\ccSetThreeColumns{Window_stream& }{}{\hspace*{8.5cm}}

The output operator is defined for all geometric classes in the \cgal\ kernel.

\ccFunction{Window_stream& operator<<(Window_stream &W, const Class &c);}
       {inserts object \ccStyle{c} into the stream \ccVar.}

\ccFunction{Window_stream& operator<<(Window_stream &W, const Color &c);}
       {changes the foreground color for the next objects that
        will be inserted into \ccVar.}

Note that CGAL points are drawn using \leda\ functions for drawing nodes of a graph.
Before drawing points, the size for drawing nodes should be adjusted, either by calling
member function \ccc{set_node_width(int)} or by 

\ccFunction{void cgalize(Window_stream& w);}
{sets a few default values for drawing in window \ccc{w}. In particular, node width is
set to 3 and line width to 2.}


\ccHeading{Input Operators}

The input operator is defined for all geometric classes in the \cgal\ kernel.
The coordinates of the geometric objects are in object space. Data are
entered with the left mouse button.

\ccFunction{Window_stream& 
        operator>>(Window_stream &W, Class &c);}
       {extracts object \ccStyle{c} from the stream \ccVar.}

\ccExample

It is important that the window stream header file gets included
{\em after} the inclusion of the header files of geometric classes
that get inserted to or extracted from the window stream.

\begin{cprog}

#include <CGAL/basic.h>
#include <CGAL/Cartesian.h>
#include <CGAL/Segment_2.h>
#include <CGAL/IO/Window_stream.h>

typedef CGAL::Point_2< CGAL::Cartesian<double> >     Point;
typedef CGAL::Segment_2< CGAL::Cartesian<double> >   Segment;

int main()
{
    Point p(0,1), q(2,2);
    Segment s(p,q);

    CGAL::Window_stream W(100,100);
    W.init(0,10,10);
    CGAL::cgalize( W);
    W.display();

    W << CGAL::RED << s << CGAL::BLACK << p << q ;
    W >> s >> p;
    return 0;
}
\end{cprog}
