This \cgal\ package provides functions to compute global informations
on the shape of a set of 2D or 3D objets such as points.
More precisely, it provides bounding box, centroid and barycenter computations,
as well as linear least squares fitting, which approximates a set
of objects by a linear sub-space such as a line or a plane.

Formally, given a set of points in $R^d$, linear least squares fitting amounts
to find the linear sub-space of $R^d$ which minimizes the sum of squared
distances from the points to their projection onto this linear sub-space. This
problem is equivalent to search for the linear sub-space which maximizes the
variance of projected points, the latter being obtained by eigen decomposition
of the covariance matrix. Eigenvectors corresponding to large eigenvalues are
the directions in which the data has strong component, or equivalently large
variance. If eigenvalues are the same there is no preferable sub-space.\\

This \cgal\ package implements the linear least squares fitting for
several objects of a CGAL 2D or 3D kernel: the best fit 2D line for 2D
point and triangle sets, and the best fit 3D line/plane for point and
triangle sets.  The sets of objects are specified by iterator ranges.
Bounding box, centroid and barycenter computations are also provided.
