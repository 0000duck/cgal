\subsection{Definition}
% +========================================================================+
  
An interval skip list is a data strucure for finding all intervals 
that contain a point, and for stabbing queries, that is for answering 
the question whether a given point is contained in an interval or not. 
The implementation we provide is dynamic, that is the user can freely
mix calls  to the methods \ccc{insert(..)}, \ccc{remove(..)}, 
\ccc{find_intervals(..)}, and \ccc{is_contained(..)}

The interval skip list class is parameterized with an interval class.

The data structure was introduced by Hanson~\cite{}, and it is called
interval skip list, because it is an extension of the randomized list
structure known as skip list~\cite{}. .

\label{sectionIntervalskiplistExamples}

We give two examples. The first one uses a basic interval class.  In
the second example we create an interval skip list for the $z$-ranges
of the faces of a terrain, allowing to answer level queries.

% +-------------------------------------------------------------+
\subsubsection{First Example with Simple Interval}

The first example reads two numbers \ccc{n} and \ccc{d} from \ccc{std::cin}.
It creates n intervals of length \ccc{d} with the left endpoint at \ccc{n}.
It then reads out the intervals for the 1-dimensional points with
coordinates $0 ... n+d$. 

The interval skip list class has as template argument an interval
class. In this example we use the class \ccc{Interval_skip_list_interval}.

\subsubsection{Example with Faces of a Triangulated Terrain}



This example creates an interval skip list that allows to find all the faces
of a terrain intersected by an horizontal plane with given level.
The data points for the terain are  read from a file. 

As model for the interval concept, we use a class that is a wrapper
around a face handle of a triangulated terrain. Lower and upper bound
of the interval are smallest and largest $z$-coordinate of the face.
