   \item[\textbf{Files misplaced in unpacking}] 
        Versions of \texttt{gtar} earlier than 1.13 may have problems unpacking
        a \cgal\ \texttt{tar} file.  In particular, files that should be 
        in subdirectories may get placed in the top directory.  This is 
        apparently due to a ``long name problem'' with earlier versions of
        \texttt{gtar}.  Fix this problem by either upgrading your installation
        of \texttt{gtar} or using simply \texttt{tar} (the non-Gnu program).
