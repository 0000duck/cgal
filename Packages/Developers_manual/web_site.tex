The web site for the cgal organization is \path|http://www.cgal.org|.
This is currently hosted by the MPI and is maintained by 
\ccAnchor{mailto:kettner@mpi-sb.mpg.de}{Lutz Kettner}.  Attempts are made to
keep this as up to date as possible, and for this the help of developers
is required.  In particular you should inform the maintainer of the
following:
\begin{itemize}
   \item new 
         \ccAnchor{http://www.cgal.org/publications_frame.html}{publications} 
         related to \cgal;
   \item updates for the 
         \ccAnchor{http://www.cgal.org/in_progress_frame.html}{work in progress}
         page, which includes work that is finished and thus no longer in 
         progress and new work.
   \item new 
         \ccAnchor{http://www.cgal.org/demos_frame.html}{demo programs}
         to be included on the web site (See Section~\ref{sec:demos_web_page}
         for the precise specification of how to submit these.)
   \item new 
         \ccAnchor{http://www.cgal.org/people_frame.html}{people}
         involved in the project
   \item new 
         \ccAnchor{http://www.cgal.org/projects_frame.html}{projects}
         using \cgal\ by people other than developers.
\end{itemize}

You should also, of course, tell the maintainer about any problems you have
with the web site.  As the error page says, ``we would like to fix them.''
