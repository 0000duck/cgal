To create a new version of the manual, you must at least do the following 
editing:
 in wrapper.tex change the line 
    \newcommand{\dmanualrelease}{2.0}
 to correspond to the current release number

 in title.html, change the line
    <H2> Release 2.0, June 2000 </H2>
 to correspond to the currrent release number and date

 in the makefile, change the titles used in the html conversion 
 (target html_doc and possible html_title) so the current version is in 
 the parentheses there

Then do
  make ps_doc
  make html_doc

Then, if necessary, edit the makefile to change the installation directory
and install the manual using:
  make install
