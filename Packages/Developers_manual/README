To create a new version of the manual, you must at least do the following 
editing:
 in wrapper.tex, pdf_wrapper.tex, ext_wrapper.tex, and ext_pdf_wrapper.tex 
 change the line 
    \newcommand{\dmanualrelease}{2.0}
 to correspond to the current release number

 in title.html, change the line
    <H2> Release 2.0, June 2000 </H2>
 to correspond to the currrent release number and date

 in the makefile, change the titles used in the html conversion 
 (target html_doc and possible html_title) so the current version is in 
 the parentheses there

Then do
  make internal  // for the internal developers' manual
  make external  // for the filtered developers' manual made public

Then, if necessary, edit the makefile to change the installation directory
and install the manual using:
  make install_internal
  make install_external

For internal release, change release num in 
   web_pages/Members/DManual/doc_panel.html
(should probably be a part of this package, but...)
