\abstract{
This document is a tutorial on how to get
started with the polyhedron data structure
provided by the Computational Geometry 
Algorithm Library (CGAL). Assuming the reader to be
familiar with the C++ template mechanisms and the key concepts of the
Standard Template Library (STL), the tutorial is organized as 
the development of a graphics modeling toolbox. We start the
toolbox with a polyhedron mesh viewer which holds a customized
polyhedron of rendering flags. The viewer also demonstrates how to 
manipulate the polyhedron including file I/O, mesh rendering and 
trackball control. Subdivision surfaces are chosen to be 
the demonstrated modeling algorithms for their combination 
of the topology and geometry operations.
We describe three different approaches with 
increasing level of sophistication and abstraction for implementing
subdivisions. The simplest approach uses the atomic Euler
operators to implement the $\sqrt{3}$ subdivision scheme. 
A second approach overloads the modifier, with the help 
of the incremental builder, in CGAL to implement 
the quad-triangle subdivision. The third approach abstracts 
the geometry operations from the refinements.
This generic approach offers a convenient way to specialize a subdivision with
the template geometry rules. Catmull-Clark, Loop and Doo-Sabin
subdivisions are illustrated using the latter approach.

\textbf{Polyhedron data structures} based on the concept of
\emph{halfedges} have been very successful for the design
of general algorithms on meshes. 
Although making a preliminary version of a halfedge-based mesh data
structure is as a fairly simple task and is often proposed as a
programming exercise, the time has come where we should not write our
own mesh data structure from scratch anymore. With the emerging of
the generic programming in C++, a set of reusable library
components for graphics modeling and geometry processing are demanded
by researchers and developers. Extensible algorithm models based on
a robust, efficient and customizable polyhedron 
data structure will certainly speed up
the research as well as the development cycle, and benefit the 
community of the graphics modeling and geometry processing.  

Most of mesh algorithms employ a customized 
halfedge data structures and most of the customizations 
are specialized by replacing the entities types, 
which are the vertex position, the normal or other 
algorithmic flags. \cgalpoly\ encapsulates a generic
design of the halfedge data structure allowing users
customize the \poly\ with the template parameters of
the geometry primitives. 
\cgalpoly\ has following excellent properties :\\
\indent $\bullet$ It is designed and implemented adopting the
\emph{generic programming paradigm}. It demonstrates the possibility
and powers of a generic geometry data structure.\\
\indent $\bullet$ It is a \emph{robust} and \emph{optimized} data structure.\\
\indent $\bullet$ A complete set of the geometry entities and predications 
is provided within CGAL.\\
\indent $\bullet$ CGAL is standardized following the C++ STL.\\

We have designed and implemented a graphics modeling toolbox
based on the \cgalpoly . This toolbox provides a
polyhedron viewer that supports file I/O, polyhedron 
rendering and trackball user control. The first part of the 
tutorial highlights the design and implementation issues 
related to the \cgalpoly\ of the toolbox.
The toolbox is also accompanied with a set of 
subdivision algorithms. The design and implementation of the 
subdivisions are explained in the second part of the tutorial.
The source codes of the toolbox and the subdivisions are 
published with the tutorial and can be 
accessed at ??.

We start the tutorial with demonstrating
how to implement a simple viewer based on the default
configuration of the \cgalpoly . This simple viewer 
demonstrates some basic functionalities of the \cgalpoly\ such as
\emph{modifier} and \emph{incremental builder} for initialization and 
the mesh traversal, i.e. the \emph{iterators} and the \emph{circulators},
for rendering or data exporting. Based on this simple
viewer, this tutorial then demonstrates
the \emph{customization of the \poly}. With primitives 
specialized with the algorithmic flags, an enriched polyhedron
is proposed and used as the core data structure in the toolbox.
With the algorithmic flags of the primitives, the viewer 
is then able to support viewing functionalities such as 
trackball manipulation and superimpose of the input mesh. 

The second part of the tutorial focuses on the design and 
the implementation of the subdivision algorithms.
In addition to the importance in surface modeling,
we choose subdivision algorithms to demonstrate
both the topology operation (refinement) and the geometry
operations (smoothing). Topology operations and the geometry
operations are the two basic operations required by
most geometry algorithms. Our implementations of the subdivisions 
are designed to be a separated library that accept 
any generic \poly\ as the input polyhedron. The key to implement
a subdivision scheme is to support the refinement.
Two approaches are first introduced to support the refinement:
the atomic Euler operators for the $\sqrt{3}$ 
subdivision (operator scheme) and the 
modifier mechanism for the Quad-Triangle subdivision 
(modifier scheme). The \emph{operator scheme} reconfigures
the connectivity with a combination of several Euler
operators. Though efficient in some refinements, 
e.g.\ $\sqrt{3}$ subdivision, the correct combination 
of the operators is hard to find for some refinements, 
e.g.\ Doo-Sabin subdivision. The \emph{modifier scheme}
solves the problem by letting the programmers 
create their own modification operators
using the polyhedron incremental builder.

All subdivisions can be represented
as a combination of a refinement and a set of smoothing
rules. Based on this observation, our third approach 
generalizes the subdivision by abstracting the smoothing rules
from the refinement. The refinement is designed as a host 
function that accepts a policy class supporting the 
smoothing rules. A subdivision function is then a 
legal combination of the refinement and the smoothing rules.
It offers a convenient way to specialize a subdivision 
with the template smoothing rules.

The intended audience of this tutorial are researchers, 
developers or students in the graphics community developing 
algorithms around meshes. Experiences on the advance C++
design (i.e.\ generic programming using templates) and
knowledge of the halfedge data structure and 
subdivisions are prerequisites.
