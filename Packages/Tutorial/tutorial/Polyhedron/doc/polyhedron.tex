A polyhedron mesh consists of \emph{topology primitives}, 
such as vertices and facets, and \emph{geometry attributes}, 
such as vertex positions and normals. 
In graphics modeling, rendering attributes, 
such as colors and texture coordinates, or algorithmic 
attributes are also part of a polyhedron mesh.
\cgalpoly\ relies on the halfedge data 
stucture \cite{hds} to provide the connectivity of 
topology primitives of the represented polyhedron mesh. 
The connectivity describes the incidences between 
primitives. \poly\ supports generic attributes 
by the templated primitives in the concept of the polyhedron
items.
