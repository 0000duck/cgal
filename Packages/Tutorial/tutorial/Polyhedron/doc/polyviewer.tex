The tutorial starts with an implementation of 
a basic polyhedron viewer based on the \cgalpoly\ with the 
default configuration.
This basic viewer demonstrates basic functionalities of a 
\cgalpoly . We describe how to import a polyhedron file in 
the OFF format based on the \italic{modifier callback mechanism} and the 
\italic{incremental builder}. We also show the mesh traversal based on
the \italic{iterators} and the \italic{circulators} for rendering and 
the OFF file exporting. 

An extended polyhedron viewer is then introduced by customizing 
the \poly\ with extra attributes and functionalities. This 
enriched polyhedron supports facet and vertex normals for rendering, 
supports the axis-aligned bounding box of the polyhedron, and 
provides geometry items specialized with algorithmic flags. 
%The extended primitives are employed to support efficient 
%computation of the number of connected components, number 
%of boundaries and combinatorial genus of the polyhedron. 
The superimposition of the control mesh on the subdivision surfaces
are implemented with the flags of the halfedge items 
(\figurename\ \ref{fig:quad-triangle}). 
%This enriched polyhedron is used as
%the core data structure of our application. 

The tutorial also features a trackball to interactively manipulate the
polyhedron, a snapshot function of the camera viewpoint and 
the transformation states, a raster output to the clipboard, and the
vectorial output to a postscript file.% (\figure\ \ref{fig:gargoyle}).
