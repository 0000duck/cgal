The application demo runs on windows and features:
\begin{itemize}

\item 
A standard document-view architecture. Accepted file formats are ASCII
off and obj (1-based vertex indices for the latter).

\item 
An OpenGL-based viewer.

\item 
An arcball for interaction.

\item 
One menu dedicated to subdivision algorithms (shortcut 's' for
quad-triangle scheme).

\item 
Some rendering options accesible through the menu render or through
the shortcut 'r'. Note that superimposing the control edges during
subdivision is only available for the quad-triangle subdivision
scheme.

\item 
A 24-bits raster image output to the clipboard (short-cut ctrl+c),

\item 
A vectorial output to an .eps file (menu file/dump to eps), editable
with \italic{e.g.}, Adobe Illustrator.

\item 
One functionality to display two models with the same viewpoint (copy
and paste viewpoint).

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Compiling on Windows}

The application has been compiled on MS .NET 2003 using CGAL 3.0,
OpenGL and MFC. The following steps are necessary to compile:
\begin{itemize}
\item Install CGAL 3.0.
\item Define an environment variable CGAL3 with the path to the CGAL-3.0 folder.
\item Compile the CGAL library in multithread mode and name the output 
      libraries resp. cgal\_mt\_debug.lib and cgal\_mt\_release.lib 
      for resp. the debug and the release mode.
\item Check your path to the library in the MS .NET project
      properties.
\item Rebuild all.
\end{itemize}
