The application demo runs on windows and features a standard MFC multi
document-view architecture. It features a trackball to interactively
manipulate the polyhedron. Accepted mesh file formats are ASCII OFF
and OBJ (1-based vertex indices for the latter). \\

Left: rotation\\
Right: translation\\
Both: zoom.\\

\noindent {\bf Main keys}\\
Press 'r' to choose a rendering mode. Note that superimposing the
control edges during subdivision is only available for the
quad-triangle subdivision scheme.\\
Press 's' to subdivide the mesh using the quad-triangle scheme.\\
Press 'ctrl+c' to generate a 24-bits raster image output to the clipboard.\\

\noindent {\bf Compiling on Windows}\\
The application has been compiled on MS .NET 2003 using CGAL. Apply
the following steps to compile the demo:
\begin{itemize}
\item Install the last release of CGAL.
\item Define an environment variable CGAL3 with the path to the CGAL-3.0 folder.
\item Compile the CGAL library in multithread mode and name the output 
      libraries resp. cgal\_mt\_debug.lib and cgal\_mt\_release.lib 
      for resp. the debug and the release mode.
\item Check your path to the library in the MS .NET project
      properties.
\item Rebuild all.
\end{itemize}
