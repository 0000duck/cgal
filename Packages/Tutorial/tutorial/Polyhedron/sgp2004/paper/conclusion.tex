We have shown the goods of CGAL and what generic programming can do
for geometry processing. ...

More types of algorithms need to be researched. ...  Something that
would be very useful: mesh simplification algorithms generic enough to
be templated by the metric error and the atomic decmation operator.

The connectivity operations are not generic enough yet ...
