\label{sec:remeshing}

Few words on remeshing (why it became a key ingredient of mesh
processing).

\subsection{Isotropic Remeshing}

Building blocks taken from CGAL:
- Polyhedron (enriched halfedges to store 
              uv coordinates per corner)
- 2D constrained Delaunay triangulation
- fast location in a triangulation (CGAL)

Algorithms:
- Conformal parameterization
- Error diffusion
- Spanning tree
- Lloyd relaxation to build a weighted 
  centroidal Voronoi diagram

\subsection{Anisotropic Remeshing}

Building blocks taken from CGAL:
- Polyhedron (enriched primitives to store curvature tensors per
vertex or per corner, plus uv coordinates)
- 2D constrained Delaunay triangulation

Algorithms:
- Conformal parameterization
- Curvature tensor estimator
- Placement of streamlines
- A bunch of algorithms which I cannot list here
