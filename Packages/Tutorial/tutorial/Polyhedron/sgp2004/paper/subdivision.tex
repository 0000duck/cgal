A subdivision surface is the limit surface resulted from the
application of a subdivision algorithm to a control polyhedron.
Subdivision algorithms recursively \emph{refine} (subdivide) 
the control polyhedron and \emph{modify} (smooth) the geometry
according to the stencils of the source mesh.
Subdivisions consist two meta-steps that most geometry processing
algorithms have: the \emph{connectivity operation} and the 
\emph{geometry operation}. In this paper, we use subdivision
as the template of the geometry processing algorithms because
it connectivity operations are more complex than most other
algorithms. Some other simple algorithms, e.g.\ displacement map,
the connectivity operation is a null operation. In other words,
the source and the target mesh have the same connectivity.
Further details on subdivisions can be found at 
\cite{siggraph1998notes}.

We characterize subdivision algorithms as the combination 
of the \emph{refinement operator} and the 
\emph{modification operator(s)}. 
The refinement operator edits the connectivity
and create a uniformly refined mesh from the source polyhedron.
Refinement operators are classified according to the connectivity
pattern and the topology correspondence. 
Figure \ref{RefSchemes} shows four major refinements employed
in subdivision algorithms, which include 
Catmull-Clark subdivision (PQQ) \cite{cc},
Loop subdivision (PTQ) \cite{loop}, 
Doo-Sabin subdivision (DQQ) \cite{ds}
and $\sqrt{3}$ subdivision \cite{sqrt3}.
Subdivisions, such as Quad-Triangle subdivision (PQQ + PTQ) \cite{sqt},
may employ a hybrid refinement that combines two different refinements.

The modification operator collects the stencil (submesh) of 
the source polyhedron and applied a mask (weighted map) 
on the stencil to generate the corresponding vertex of 
the target (refined) polyhedron. Figure \ref{fig:RefMap} 
demonstrates the examples of the correspondence 
between a stencil and its smoothed vertices. Subdivisions
usually have several modification operators associated with different
different types of stencils (Figure \ref{fig:RefMap} (a-c)). 
The modification operators iterate on all entities of the target
mesh.

	   subdivision has three stencils: facet-stencil (a), 
	   edge-stencil (b) and vertex-stencil (c).}

In the following two sections, we demonstrate the implementation of
the subdivisions based on the \cgalpoly.
We introduce two non-polymorphism designs of the subdivisions. 
To support the refinement operators, one applies the 
atomic connectivity operators and the other 
uses the modifier of the \cgalpoly . 
The modification operations are statically wired in the 
refinement operator. The polymorphism design is shown latter in 
section \ref{sect:} where modification operators are abstracted
from the refinement.
