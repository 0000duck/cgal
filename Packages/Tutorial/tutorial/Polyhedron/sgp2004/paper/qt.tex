The quad-triangle subdivision scheme was introduced by
Levin~\cite{l-pg-03}, then Stam and Loop~\cite{sl-qts-02}. It applies
to polygon meshes and basically features Loop subdivision on triangles
and Catmull-Clark subdivision on polygons of the control mesh (see
Fig.\ref{fig:quad-triangle}). After one iteration of subdivision the
subdivided model is only composed of triangles and quads. A simple
solution for implementing such a scheme is to use the
\italic{incremental builder} concept featured by CGAL 
Polyhedron (see Section~\ref{sec:builder}).
