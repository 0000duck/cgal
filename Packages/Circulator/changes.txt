Circulator Package: Release changes:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

3.23 (21 Mar 2002)

     - Maintenance moved to Lutz Kettner, MPI Saarbruecken.
     - Removed doc_tex/use_of_stl/*.
     - Deleted include/CGAL/circulator_compat.h that was no longer
       in the release. It was the old pre-iterator_traits implementation.
     - Deleted doc_tex/support/Circulator/wrapper.tex.

3.22 (20 Mar 2002)
     - Fixed problem in Circulator_from_iterator for VC7. Initializes
       the circulator now from a static member variable instead of
       each time a new default construction of the internal iterator type.

3.3 (02 Sep 1999)

     One more patch for MSC_VCC.

3.2 (01 Sep 1999)

     Changed to work with MSC_VCC.

3.1 (12 Aug 1999)

     Fully reworked version. The package relies now on template parameter
     defaults and std::iterator_traits. For compilers yet not supporting
     std::iterator_traits, the old circulator.h file of CGAL R2.0 is
     distributed for compatibility reasons under the name 
     circulator_compat.h

     The use of std::iterator_traits allowed me to simplify many parts of
     this package. An adapter class was provided for each iterator/circulator
     category. This is now unified to one adapter for all categories,
     deriving its actual category with the std::iterator_traits.
     Furthermore, many internal implementations have been simplified.
     Important, the package is nevertheless backwards compatible.

     The documentation is new. It is separated into a user manual part and
     and a reference part, but for the transition period both parts stay
     in one chapter. The manual needs the cc_manual tools R3.2 (not yet
     released) for formatting.

2.6 (22 May 1999)

     Typos before CGAL R2.0 fixed.

2.5 (29 Apr 1999)

     circulator_bases.h include cstddef now.

2.4 (07 Apr 1999)

     Fixes std:: prefix for base classes to CGAL_STD:: in 
     circulator_base.h. std:: namespace added for sort().

2.3 (26 Mar 1999)

    A single missing std:: for a vector fixed.

2.2 (25 Mar 1999)

    A few std:: fixed, derivation from std::forward_iterator etc. 
    removed and some CGAL_TEMPLATE_NULL introduced for the traits
    classes.

2.1 (06 Mar 1999)

     Standard headers, std namespace and CGAL namespace.

1.15 (07 Oct 1998)

     Bug with respect to value_type friend function and value_type type
     fixed. Warnings about CGAL_NULL_TYPE with egcs fixed.

1.14 (03 Jun 1998)

     A few changes in the doc. Chapter entry in header.

1.13 (09 Apr 1998)

     Spell checker.

1.12 (18 Mar 1998)

     A few typename's in the examples removed. Run's with SGI CC-n32.
     Problems with operator+ and SGI CC-64 fixed.

1.11 (18 Feb 1998)

     A few typename's in inappropriate places removed. Run's with SGI CC-n32.

1.10 (05 Feb 1998)

     Reorganized TeX files for the manual and minor changes in the manual.

1.9 (30 Jan 1998)

     New cgal_test script. CGAL_circulator_distance has now difference_type
     as return type. New function CGAL_iterator_distance working on both,
     iterators and circulators. New header file CGAL/circulator_bases.h
     that includes only circulator tags and base classes.

1.8 (06 Jan 1998)

     A missing typename inserted for egcs.

1.7 (19 Dec 1997)

     Tested with egcs. New subsections with \ccSeeAlso.


1.6 (12 Dec 1997)

     The container-from-circulator adaptor classes cannot be used for
     non-mutable circulators if the C++ compiler has the
     CGAL_CFG_NO_LAZY_INSTANTIATION bug. However, the g++ works fine,
     only some warnings about const to non-const conversions.
     The related tests for the container-from-circulator adaptors are
     now guarded with the CGAL_CFG_NO_LAZY_INSTANTIATION flag.

     All scope expressions with the typename keyword where necessary
     (not tested yet). Include file protection as provided with the script.

     Circulators work now with iterator traits! Tested with SGI CC 7.2.


1.5 (11 Dec 1997)

     Circulator functions matches now appropriately to the circulator tags
     instead of the iterator tags as previously. Bug reported by Wieger
     while testing with Borland. The problem with the non-const iterator
     adaptor in the container_from_circulator adaptor classes cannot
     be fixed. The g++ is known to warn about conversion from const    
     to non-const references even though the class is actually not used.
     SunPro and SGI C++ works fine. The Borland now reports error messages.


1.4 (09 Dec 1997)

     Includes now the TeX documentation for the support library and the
     stl_extension manual. Includes new package field in the header.

     The dependency on Gnu and SunPro C++ has been reduced.

     The adaptors for circulators for a struct, class or array which
     uses the member function pointer as a template argument (could be
     recognized as those classes with an _mptr suffix) have been removed.
     They were even no longer documented in R1.3.


1.3 (25 Nov 1997)

     Compliant to recent organisational conventions that the examples
     directory gets tested and that there is a new demo directory.


Changes compared to CGAL 0.9:

     New features are: strong support of size_type for circulators.
     Base classes have additional template argument for that.
     Support of local types for pointer and const_pointer.      
     All circulators and iterators provide operator->() if supported
     by the compiler. The handling of the iterator category has been
     changed such that the tags for circulators (which are derived
     from the iterator tags) are been used. A new function
     CBP_circulator_size computes the size of the range of two
     circulators (i.e. the positive distance between both).
