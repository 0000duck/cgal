CGAL Planar map demo

This demo program lets you construct a planar map.
Construct the planar map using the scenes

- Start/end points of line segments for the planar map and

- Input segments of the planar map

The program will show you the faces of the planar map in
different colors.

Activate the other two point scenes to input points that
are used to demonstrate the locate routine of the planar
map and the vertical ray shooting.
