- Remove the requirement to have a ./.geomview file with (echo "started")
  inside.  Synchronization can probably be done with select() ?
  There are other problems (sleep(1) is needed), so maybe don't touch...
- Write operator<<(Triangulation), 2D and 3D.  Partly done.
- Why not use the OOGL library coming with Geomview to parse stuff ?
- The remote geomview (with rsh) facility probably doesn't work.
  But is it useful ?
- Add operator<< (Sphere), as it's known to geomview, cf :
  http://www.geomview.org/docs/html/geomview_44.html#SEC47
