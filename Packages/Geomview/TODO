- Add flags to the stream that say :
  - draw vertices or not
  - draw edges or not
  - draw surfaces or not (fill or wired).
  Note that Geomview already has the possibility to do these things from the
  menus, so...
- Finish get rid of standard deprecated (and gcc 2.97 unfriendly) strstream.

  It's harder than I thought, since g++ 2.95 doesn't have <sstream>.
  Maybe CGAL should define it ?
- Remove the requirement to have a .geomview file with (echo "started")
  inside.  Synchronization can probably be done with select() ?
  There are other problems (sleep(1) is needed), so maybe don't touch...
  It must be backward-compatible...
  Question : is there a need for backward compatibility, given that
  operator>>(Point) probably never worked ???
- The remote geomview (with rsh) facility probably doesn't work.
  But is it useful ?
- What to do for Circle_2 ?  Maybe there's some code somewhere, or ask the
  geomview list.  Or do the discretisation ourselves, maybe it's the kernel's
  job ?  Discretisation for Sphere and Circle should be configurable for the
  stream.
- See how we can mix the Color output with the raw mode.
  Currently it's not clear to me.
- Check how to do transparency with Geomview ?
  (passing the one from CGAL::Color)
- Is there a way to see edges like cylinders somewhat (possibly generate them
  ourselves), so that we know which one is in front of which other one ?
- For T3D : I want to be able to tell Geomview or the CGAL program to stop
  displaying a tetrahedron that I select, so that I can see the inside.
- Why not use the OOGL library coming with Geomview to parse stuff ?

Demo :
------
- Add demo files for polyhedrons, t2D, t3d.
- Add a note in the doc when triangulation outputs are ready.
