- Remove the requirement to have a ./.geomview file with (echo "started")
  inside.  Synchronization can probably be done with select() ?
  There are other problems (sleep(1) is needed), so maybe don't touch...
- Write operator<<(Triangulation), 2D and 3D.  Partly done.
- Why not use the OOGL library coming with Geomview to parse stuff ?
- The remote geomview (with rsh) facility probably doesn't work.
  But is it useful ?
- Add operator<< (Sphere), as it's known to geomview, cf :
  http://www.geomview.org/docs/html/geomview_44.html#SEC47

- Make a testsuite (words from Herve):
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
Geomview testsuite:

It's not clear how to make it at this point...
After talking to Francois, I got the following idea:

* make sure . is in the path
* create a local script called geomview, so that upon creating the
  Geomview_stream(), the call execlp("geomview",...)  calls ./geomview instead
  of the 3D viewer
* that script will simply process gcl (geomview command language) so that it
  reports on its output exactly the objects that are given from the input
* the testsuite will simply consist of outputting the different objects into
* the
  geomview stream, and getting them back, and comparing.

This should allow the testsuite to be fully automatic and yet test all the
documented features of the package. How to do it remains to be cleared.
Any volunteers?

- Now I think that testing compilation for all kernel (and others) objects
  output may be already nice, and simple.
  Maybe we can start geomview with no single window via command line options
  of environement variables ?
