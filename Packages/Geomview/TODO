- Finish get rid of standard deprecated (and gcc 2.97 unfriendly) strstream.
  http://www.cmla.ens-cachan.fr/Utilisateurs/dosreis/C++/FAQ/
  It's harder than I thought, since g++ 2.95 doesn't have <sstream>.
  Maybe CGAL should define it ?  Or simply CGAL should define
  <strstream> = <backward/strstream> for gcc > 2.95 ?
  Or wait for an update of gcc that fixes it ? :)
- The remote geomview (with rsh) facility probably doesn't work.
  But is it useful ?
- What to do for Circle_2 ?  Maybe there's some code somewhere, or ask the
  geomview list.  Or do the discretisation ourselves, maybe it's the kernel's
  job ?  Discretisation for Sphere and Circle should be configurable for the
  stream.
- See how we can mix the Color output with the raw mode.
  Currently it's not clear to me.
  Check how to do transparency with Geomview ?
  (passing the one from CGAL::Color)
- Is there a way to see edges like cylinders somewhat (possibly generate them
  ourselves), so that we know which one is in front of which other one ?
- For T3D : I want to be able to tell Geomview or the CGAL program to stop
  displaying a tetrahedron that I select, so that I can see the inside.
  Maybe it's not really worth it, finally.  See the real needs first.
- See how we can use this as a debugger : ask Frederic details on his stuff.
  The fact we're multiprocess probably means we'll even have less problems
  than multi-threads...
- Why not use the OOGL library coming with Geomview to parse stuff ?

Demo :
------
- Add demo files for polyhedrons, t2D, t3d.
- Add a note in the doc when triangulation outputs are ready.

Doc:
---
- why are the biblio references missing ?  Fscking LaTeX...
