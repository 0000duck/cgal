- Remove the requirement to have a ./.geomview file with (echo "started")
  inside.  Synchronization can probably be done with select() ?
- Reading a Point from Geomview should be possible.  It works, but not all the
  time, there's some non-deterministic bug somewhere, either geomview or CGAL.
- Write operator<<(Triangulation), 2D and 3D.  Use "(progn" ... ")" from GCL
  for that ?
- Use the OOGL library coming with Geomview to parse stuff ?
- Fix non-std compliant names beginning with underscore : grep -r '\<_' .
