Geomview testsuite:

It's not clear how to make it at this point...
After talking to Francois, I got the following idea:

* make sure . is in the path
* create a local script called geomview, so that upon creating the
  Geomview_stream(), the call execlp("geomview",...)  calls ./geomview instead
  of the 3D viewer
* that script will simply process gcl (geomview command language) so that it
  reports on its output exactly the objects that are given from the input
* the testsuite will simply consist of outputting the different objects into the
  geomview stream, and getting them back, and comparing.
  
This should allow the testsuite to be fully automatic and yet test all the
documented features of the package. How to do it remains to be cleared.
Any volunteers?
