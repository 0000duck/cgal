Ver 3.12 (5  June 2001)
- read() and write() are not in std::.

Ver 3.11 (30 May 2001)
- Use std:: for C library functions for GCC 3.

Ver 3.10 (23 May 2001)
- Don't compile the demos at all on Windows.

Ver 3.9 (17 April 2001)
- Add documentation for the previous change.
- Draw intersection of the BBox for Ray_2 and Line_2.
- Update for Geomview 1.8.1 (endianness bug on Linux).
- Remove buggy references in the doc.

Ver 3.8 (23 January 2001)
- Added (simple) operator<<() for Ray_[23] and Line_[23].

Ver 3.7 (7 December 2000)
- Added a member function get_new_id(string) to replace and generalize the
  per type counters used to get unique identifiers for geomview.
  It fixes the bug that you couldn't see several polyhedrons or triangulations
  at the same time.

Ver 3.6 (5 December 2000)
- Factorized code between Point_[23], Segment_[23] and Triangle_[23].
- Added some color to the kernel demo program.
- Added a wired flag, with the get/set functions.
- Use this flag in operator<<(Triangulations), and add a pointer in the doc.
- Demo program for triangulations/terrains.

Ver 3.5 (1 December 2000)
- New echo_flag boolean, that decides when a point Geomview gives us needs to
  be echoed to Geomview.
- Proper save and restore of the ascii/binary mode.
- in_binary_mode() -> get_binary_mode(), idem for ascii.
- set_binary_mode() now takes a parameter (default=true), and returns the old
  value.
- (echo "started") in your .geomview file is no longer necessary.

Ver 3.4 (29 November 2000)
- Removed the cruft about "ascii" and "binary" function pointers (beurk !).
- Added a raw mode, and use it internally : get_raw() and set_raw().
- More cleanup.

Ver 3.3 (29 November 2000)
- to_double -> CGAL::to_double.
- char * -> string.
- Got rid of some useless and deprecated strstreams.
- Fixed a bug in frame().
- Removed obsolete code concerning the very old (born dead) 3D triangulation.
- Do not submit test/Geomview/Makefile.
- New directory demo/Geomview.

Ver 3.2 (24 November 2000)
- Forgot to submit the test/ directory.

Ver 3.1 (24 November 2000)
- Removed obsolete constructor.
- Added a sleep(1) at initialization, to wait for Geomview to be ready
  (internally), because otherwise this prevents operator>>(Point) from working
  later (even if display is fine).
- Fix non-std compliant names beginning with underscore.
- Replaced close()+dup() by dup2() at initialization.
- Added code to draw a Sphere_3.
- Added a test program !

Ver 3.0 (16 October 00)
- Added "\newpage" from Susan's changes for CGAL 2.2.
- Put myself as maintainer. [syl]

---- CGAL 2.2 is out. ----

Ver 2.9 (8 August 00)
- find back the tex files which had disappear

Ver 2.8 (27 June 00)
- Rewrote is_prefix() and nth() [syl].

Ver 2.7 (13 janvier 00)
undo the previous, 
and replace "ends" by "std::ends"

Ver 2.6 (13 janvier 00)
added std:: in front of "flush" ans "ends"

Ver 2.5 (27 July 1999)
added std:: in front of "flush" ans "ends"

Ver 2.4 (23 July 1999)
included #if !defined in src/Geomview_stream.C
because Geomview is not supported by M$C and BORLANDC

Ver 2.3 (2 July 1999)
added std::

Ver 2.2 18 Mai 99
 Corrected doc files 

Ver 2.1 16 April 99
 Changed read and write in Geomview_stream.C
 to ::read and ::write to avoid clashes with CGAL::read and CGAL::write

Ver 2.0 13 April 99
-Intoduced namespaces. Still certain std:: are missing in src files
 because I am not quite sure where to put them.

Ver 1.4 (to appear)
- Added include <stdlib.h> for prototypes: exit(), ...
- Removed warning in Geomview_stream.C (unused variable length in CGAL_nth)

Ver 1.3 (29 Sept 1998)
- Removed variables CGAL_RSH and CGAL_GEOMVIEW. Use default values instead.
- Removed makefile_geomview, and compile always with libCGAL.
+ for this, one must add Geomview_stream.o to CGAL_Objects in makefile_lib
- Typo CCAL --> CGAL
- Added operator<<(Polyhedron<T,HDS> &P) in the documentation

Ver 1.2 (23 Jun 1998)
Changes suggested by  Aalim Fevens <fevens@qucis.queensu.ca>
- In Chapter 8 on Geomview in Reference Manual Part 3 on page 81,
  the Input Operators for CGAL Kernel Classes should be for the
  CGAL_Point_3(R> point class, not the CGAL_Point_2<R> point
  class. The latter class is not yet in the include file for
  Geomview as far as I can see.
- bug in include/CGAL/IO/Geomview_stream.h at line 243

Ver 1.1 (22 Jun 1998)
- Changed the defaults of CGAL_RSH to "rsh" and CGAL_GEOMVIEW to
  "geomview" (assuming the user has them in his path, otherwise
  he wouldn't be able to install them)
- Probably the best is to patch the script "install_cgal", its
  manual, so that it is all done automagically. Unfortunately,
  I ran into problems when writing this patch. For one thing, sed
  couln't update makefile_geomview. Ask me
  (Herve.Bronnimann@#sophia.inria.fr) if you want this patch.

Ver 1.0 (31 Mar 1998)
- added makefile_geomview in src, with two environment variable CGAL_RSH and
  CGAL_GEOMVIEW which have to be redefined for other installations than the
  default. The default is:
            CGAL_RSH=\"/usr/ucb/rsh\"
            CGAL_GEOMVIEW=\"/usr/local/bin/geomview\"
- added #include <CGAL/IO/Polyhedron_geomview_ostream.h>

Ver 0.9 (25 Feb 1998)
- preliminary version (not tested)
