CHANGES to the Geomview package.

Ver 3.1 ???
- Removed obsolete constructor.
- Added a sleep(1) at initialization, to wait for Geomview to be ready
  (internally), because otherwise this prevents operator>>(Point) from working
  later (even if display is fine).
- Fix non-std compliant names beginning with underscore.
- Replaced close()+dup() by dup2() at initialization.

Ver 3.0 (16 October 00)
- Added "\newpage" from Susan's changes for CGAL 2.2.
- Put myself as maintainer. [syl]

---- CGAL 2.2 is out. ----

Ver 2.9 (8 August 00)
- find back the tex files which had disappear

Ver 2.8 (27 June 00)
- Rewrote is_prefix() and nth() [syl].

Ver 2.7 (13 janvier 00)
undo the previous, 
and replace "ends" by "std::ends"

Ver 2.6 (13 janvier 00)
added std:: in front of "flush" ans "ends"

Ver 2.5 (27 July 1999)
added std:: in front of "flush" ans "ends"

Ver 2.4 (23 July 1999)
included #if !defined in src/Geomview_stream.C
because Geomview is not supported by M$C and BORLANDC

Ver 2.3 (2 July 1999)
added std::

Ver 2.2 18 Mai 99
 Corrected doc files 

Ver 2.1 16 April 99
 Changed read and write in Geomview_stream.C
 to ::read and ::write to avoid clashes with CGAL::read and CGAL::write

Ver 2.0 13 April 99
-Intoduced namespaces. Still certain std:: are missing in src files
 because I am not quite sure where to put them.

Ver 1.4 (to appear)
- Added include <stdlib.h> for prototypes: exit(), ...
- Removed warning in Geomview_stream.C (unused variable length in CGAL_nth)

Ver 1.3 (29 Sept 1998)
- Removed variables CGAL_RSH and CGAL_GEOMVIEW. Use default values instead.
- Removed makefile_geomview, and compile always with libCGAL.
+ for this, one must add Geomview_stream.o to CGAL_Objects in makefile_lib
- Typo CCAL --> CGAL
- Added operator<<(Polyhedron<T,HDS> &P) in the documentation

Ver 1.2 (23 Jun 1998)
Changes suggested by  Aalim Fevens <fevens@qucis.queensu.ca>
- In Chapter 8 on Geomview in Reference Manual Part 3 on page 81,
  the Input Operators for CGAL Kernel Classes should be for the
  CGAL_Point_3(R> point class, not the CGAL_Point_2<R> point
  class. The latter class is not yet in the include file for
  Geomview as far as I can see.
- bug in include/CGAL/IO/Geomview_stream.h at line 243

Ver 1.1 (22 Jun 1998)
- Changed the defaults of CGAL_RSH to "rsh" and CGAL_GEOMVIEW to
  "geomview" (assuming the user has them in his path, otherwise
  he wouldn't be able to install them)
- Probably the best is to patch the script "install_cgal", its
  manual, so that it is all done automagically. Unfortunately,
  I ran into problems when writing this patch. For one thing, sed
  couln't update makefile_geomview. Ask me
  (Herve.Bronnimann@#sophia.inria.fr) if you want this patch.

Ver 1.0 (31 Mar 1998)
- added makefile_geomview in src, with two environment variable CGAL_RSH and
  CGAL_GEOMVIEW which have to be redefined for other installations than the
  default. The default is:
            CGAL_RSH=\"/usr/ucb/rsh\"
            CGAL_GEOMVIEW=\"/usr/local/bin/geomview\"
- added #include <CGAL/IO/Polyhedron_geomview_ostream.h>

Ver 0.9 (25 Feb 1998)
- preliminary version (not tested)
