Polyhedron Package: Release changes:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
2.9 (13 Sep 2000)

     std::distance in examples/Polyhedron/polyhedron_prog_off.C changed.
     Vertex, Halfedge, and Facet class prefixed with Polyhedron
     in the doc.

2.8 (25 Nov 1999)

     Small fix in Polyhedron_incremental_builder_3.

2.7 (25 Nov 1999)

     Two small changes in Polyhedron_incremental_builder_3 for MSVC.
     A couple of changes in Polyhedron_3 renaming local types for
     MSVC (Halfedge to Halfedge_ etc.).

2.6 (18 Nov 1999)

     CGAL_TEMPLATE_NULL added to Polyhedron_circulator_traits definition.
     Some std:: added for endl.

2.5 (22 May 1999)

     Typos before CGAL R2.0 fixed.

2.4 (20 Apr 1999)

     Bug in test-suite code fixed that caused the P.is_tetrahedron( g)
     assertion to fail.

2.3 (12 Apr 1999)

     Example programs fixed.

2.2 (07 Apr 1999)

     iterator_test.any removed (not used anyway).

2.1 (09 Mar 1999)

     Standard headers, std namespace and CGAL namespace. Bug fix in
     erase_facet. Minor cleanups. join_loop and join_facet accept holes.
     Edge_iterator const assignable.

1.14 (14 Jan 1999)

     Make the default assignment operator return *this.

1.13 (04 Jan 1999)

     Made the default assignment operator explicit to help the EGCS
     compiler to compile the convex hull demo program.

1.12 (08 Oct 1998)
     
     A new example illustrates the easy computation of a plane equation
     for polyhedral surface facets in the case of convex facets.
        A false assertion has been corrected in the rollback functionality
     of the polyhedron incremental builder. This false assertion could
     have caused the builder to crash when the rollback was activated,
     e.g. in the case of a file read error.

1.11 (10 Jul 1998)

     Iterators and circulators separated in own include file.
     New methods: erase_facet, erase_connected_component, and
     erase_all. Bug in join_vertex with respect to boundary
     edges fixed. The is_tetrahedron test does no longer allow
     border edges (empty facets) in the tetrahedron.
     Makefile equipped with LONG_NAME workaround.

1.10 (03 Jun 1998)

     A few changes in the doc. Chapter entry in header.

1.9 (09 Apr 1998)

     Spell checker. Filenames in examples corrected.

1.8 (24 Mar 1998)

     Small fix in operator+ operations for iterators/circulators.

1.7 (18 Mar 1998)

     Two missing typenames added.

1.6 (05 Mar 1998)

     Shorter names for internal classes, programs
     included for TeX manual. Small change in doc.

1.5 (25 Feb 1998)

     Major reorganisation. Renaming of Polyhedron_traits into
     Halfedge_data_structure with its own package Halfedge_DS.
     A new traits class for Polyhedrons with geometric issues.
     The decorator belongs now to Halfedge_DS. It has additional
     functionality like is_valid, normalize_border, fill_hole,
     make_hole ...

1.4 (10 Feb 1998)

     New cgal_test script. typename's and redundant include guards 
     added. Tested with egcs and g++ 2.8. Compiles but does not link.
     Linker relocation error I cannot solve at the moment.
     Renaming of traits class to halfedge data structure postponed
     to next package release. Bug fixed in fill_hole.
     Includes now the TeX documentation for the basic library manual. 
     Includes new package field in the header. The dependency on Gnu
     and SunPro C++ has been reduced.

None of this package was available in CGAL 0.9.
