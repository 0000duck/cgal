Polyhedron Package
---------------------------------------------------------------------

-  CGAL/Polyhedron_3.h

     Polyhedral surfaces in 3D based on HalfedgeDS.

-  CGAL/Polyhedron_iterator_3.h

     Iterator and circulator used for polyhedral surfaces (and maybe
     other data structures based on the halfedge data structure as well.

-  CGAL/Polyhedron_default_traits_3.h

     A default traits class for polyhedral surfaces based on the
     CGAL-kernel.

-  CGAL/Polyhedron_incremental_builder_3.h

     An incremental builder useful when creating polyhedral surfaces 
     from file formats.

-  CGAL/Polyhedron_copy_3.h

     A modifier able of copying or appending polyhedral surfaces.
     (Not documented in the manual)

-  CGAL/Polyhedron_old/*

     Files for the old design. They are automatically included
     from the files above in case the old design is selected.
