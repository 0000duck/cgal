\ccDefinition
  
A polyhedral surface \ccClassTemplateName\ consists of vertices $V$,
edges $E$, facets $F$ and an incidence relation on them.  Each edge is
represented by two halfedges with opposite orientations.

Vertices represent points in 3d-space. Edges are straight line segments
between two endpoints. Facets are planar polygons without holes
defined by the circular sequence of halfedges along their boundary.
The polyhedral surface itself can have holes. The halfedges
along the boundary of a hole are called {\em border halfedges\/} and
have no incident facet. An edge is a {\em border edge\/} if one of
its halfedges is a border halfedge.  A surface is {\em closed\/} if it
contains no border halfedges. A closed surface is a boundary
representation for polyhedra in three dimensions. The convention is
that the halfedges are oriented counterclockwise around facets as seen
from the outside of the polyhedron. An implication is that the
halfedges are oriented clockwise around the vertices. The notion of
the solid side of a facet as defined by the halfedge orientation
extends to polyhedral surfaces with border edges although they do not
define a closed object. If normal vectors are considered for the
facets, normals point outwards (following the right hand rule).

The strict definition can be found in~\cite{k-ugpdd-99}. One
implication of this definition is that the polyhedral surface is
always an orientable and oriented 2-manifold with border edges, i.e.
the neighborhood of each point on the polyhedral surface is either
homeomorphic to a disc or to a half disc, except for vertices where
many holes and surfaces can join. Another implication is that the
smallest representable surface is a triangle (for polyhedral surfaces
with border edges) or a tetrahedron (for polyhedra). Boundary
representations of orientable 2-manifolds are closed under Euler
operations. They are extended with operations that create or close
holes in the surface.

Other intersections besides the incidence relation are not allowed,
although they are not automatically handled, since self intersections
are not easy to check efficiently. \ccClassTemplateName\ does only
maintain the combinatorial integrity of the polyhedral surface (using
Euler operations) and does not consider the coordinates of the points
or any geometric information.

The class \ccClassTemplateName\ can represent polyhedral surfaces as
well as polyhedra. The interface is designed in such a way that it
is easy to ignore border edges and work only with polyhedra.

The sequence of edges can be ordered in the data structure on request
such that the sequence starts with the non-border edges and ends with
the border edges. Border edges are then itself ordered such that the
halfedge which is incident to the facet comes first and the halfedge
incident to the hole comes thereafter. This normalization step counts
simultaneously the number of border edges. This number is zero if and
only if the surface is a closed polyhedron. Note that this class does
not maintain this counter nor the halfedge order during further
modifications. There is no automatic caching done for auxiliary
information.

\ccInclude{CGAL/Polyhedron_3.h}

\ccParameters

The full template declaration of \ccClassTemplateName\ states three parameters:

\begin{tabbing}
\ccc{template <} \=\ccc{class Traits,}\\
                 \>\ccc{class Items  = CGAL::Polyhedron_items_3,}\\
                 \>\ccc{template < class T, class I>}
                 \ccc{class HDS = CGAL::HalfedgeDS_default>}\\
     \ccc{class Polyhedron_3;}
\end{tabbing}
   
The first parameter \ccc{Traits} expects a model of the
\ccc{Polyhedron_traits} concept, for example \ccc{CGAL::Polyhedron_traits_3}.
The second parameter expects a model of the \ccc{Polyhedron_items} concept.
By default, the class \ccc{CGAL::Polyhedron_items_3} is preselected. The third 
parameter is a class template. A model of the \ccc{HalfedgeDS} concept is 
expected. By default, the class \ccc{CGAL::HalfedgeDS_default} is preselected, 
which is a list based implementation of the halfedge data structure.

The following handles, iterators and circulators have appropriate
non-mutable counterparts, i.e.~\ccc{const_handle},
\ccc{const_iterator} and \ccc{const_circulator}. The mutable types are
assignable to their non-mutable counterparts.  Both circulators are
assignable to the \ccc{Halfedge_iterator}. The iterators are
assignable to the respective handle types. Wherever the handles appear
in function parameter lists, the corresponding iterators can be used as
well. For convenience, the \ccc{Edge_iterator} enumerates every other 
halfedge. It is based on the \ccc{CGAL::N_step_adaptor} adapter. For
convenience, the \ccc{Point_iterator} enumerates all points in the polyhedral
surface in the same order as the \ccc{Vertex_iterator}, but with the 
value type \ccc{Point}. It is based on the \ccc{CGAL::Iterator_project} adaptor.

     with a new diagonal between the two vertices denoted by \ccc{h} and

     first facet. It returns the new diagonal. The new face is to the

     vertices. The halfedge sequence \ccc{hnew}, \ccc{g->next()->opposite()},
     \ldots, \ccc{h} remains around the old vertex, while the 
     halfedge sequence \ccc{hnew->opposite()}, \ccc{h->next()->opposite()},

\ccHeading{Operations with Border Halfedges}

\begin{ccAdvanced}
  
Halfedges incident to a hole are called {\em border
  halfedges}. An halfedge is a {\em border edge\/} if itself or its
opposite halfedge are border halfedges. The only requirement to work
with border halfedges is that the \ccc{Halfedge} class provides a
member function \ccc{is_border()} returning a \ccc{bool}. Usually,
the halfedge data structure supports facets and a \ccc{NULL} facet
pointer will indicate a border halfedge, but this is not the only
possibility. The \ccc{is_border()} predicate divides the edges into
two classes, the border edges and the non-border edges. The
following normalization reorganizes the sequential storage of the
edges such that the non-border edges precedes the border edges, and
that for each border edge the latter one of the two halfedges is a
border halfedge (the first one is a non-border halfedge in conformance
  with the polyhedral surface definition). The
normalization stores the number of border halfedges and the halfedge
iterator the border edges start at within the data
structure.  Halfedge insertion or removal and changing the border
status of a halfedge may invalidate these values, which are not
automatically updated.

\ccMethod{void   normalize_border();}
    {sorts halfedges such that the non-border edges precedes the
     border edges. For each border edge the halfedge iterator will
    reference the halfedge incident to the facet right before the
    halfedge incident to the hole.}

\ccMethod{size_type size_of_border_edges() const;}
    {number of border edges. Since each border edge of a polyhedral
    surface has exactly one border halfedge,
    this number is equal to \ccc{size_of_border_halfedges()}.

    border edges is checked too. This method checks in particular level 3 of
    \ccc{CGAL::Halfedge_data_structure_decorator::is_valid} from
    page~\ref{pageHalfedgeDSconstDecoratorRef} and that each facet is at least
    a triangle and that the two incident facets of a non-border edge are

\ccMethod{bool normalized_border_is_valid( const HDS& hds,

    returns \ccc{true} if the border halfedges are in normalized 
    representation, which is when enumerating all halfedges with the
    iterator: The non-border edges precedes the border edges and for
    border edges, the second halfedge is the border halfedge. The halfedge
    iterator \ccc{border_halfedges_begin()} denotes the first border
    edge. If \ccc{verbose} is \ccc{true}, statistics are
    printed to \ccc{cerr}.
