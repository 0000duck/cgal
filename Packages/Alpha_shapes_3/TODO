Still to be done :

- fixed the doc :
  mainly fixes in Alpha_shapes_base_cell_3 +
  new enum  value SUPER_REGULAR for vertices

- Improve efficiency
  - avoid to be build alpha_edge_maps and edge_alpha_map
    in regularized mode
    edges can be classify on the fly
 - replace memory allocation on the stack by a compaccontainer
   for Alpha_status
   Alpha_status for vertices can be stored in vertices
