08 May 2004 Sylvain Pion
- Use CGAL_USE_GEOMVIEW

07 May 2004 Andreas Fabri
- Prefixed Alpha_shape_status with CGAL::  (to get rid of error msg of SunPro CC)
- Replaced std::make_pair with Alpha_{cell,vertex}_map::value_type (to get rid of error msg of SunProCC)

05 May 2004 Andreas Fabri
- Added missing std:: to find in Alpha_shape_3.h

29 April 2004 Mariette Yvinec
- removed an old test file which I had forgotten to remove from cvs

28 April 2004 Mariette Yvinec
- major changes in the implementation of Alpha_shapes_3.h
  New implementation should result in a true GENERAL  mode
  allowing null and negative alpha-values.
  Still to be done: fix the doc + improve efficiency.
