  abstract =     "The R-tree, one of the most popular access methods for
                 rectangles, is based on the heuristic optimization of
                 the area of the enclosing rectangle in each inner node.
                 By running numerous experiments in a standardized
                 testbed under highly varying data, queries and
                 operations, we were able to design the R-tree which
                 incorporates a combined optimization of area, margin
                 and overlap of each enclosing rectangle in the
                 directory. Using our standardized testbed in an
                 exhaustive performance comparison, it turned out that
                 the R-tree clearly outperforms the existing R-tree
                 variants: Guttman's linear and quadratic R-tree and
                 Greene's variant of the R-tree. This superiority of the
                 R-tree holds for different types of queries and
                 operations, such as map overlay, for both rectangles
                 and multidimensional points in all experiments. From a
                 practical point of view the R-tree is very attractive
                 because of the following two reasons: 1. it efficiently
                 supports point and spatial data at the same time and 2.
                 its implementation cost is only slightly higher than
                 that of other R-trees.",
