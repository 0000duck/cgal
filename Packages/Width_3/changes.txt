1.8
- Moving to CVS Server and completed truncated text in description.txt

1.7
- To fix the problem with Microsoft Visual C: Replaced all function 
  calls by resolving explicitly all typename's within the signature
  and adding the corresponding class to the list of template
  parameters. There are some functions that have now a dummy data
  access object.
- Some typename's have been replaced by a macro to please Microsoft VC
  compiler.  
- Added 2 typename's within debug regions
- Now test_width_simplex.C is the same in the text directory and the
  test directory

- Renamed class DA to Data_access to please Windows compilers bcc32
  and CL

- At Line 1402: inserted CGAL:: before DA<...>
