1.14 (18 Mar 2002)
- Const correctness in Data_access of Width_polyhedron.

1.13 (31 Jul 2001)
- Susan moved doc_tex/*_ref directory up one level

1.12 (16 Jul 2001)
- Removed unused argc and argv parameter from main().

1.11 (13 Jul 2001)
- fixed Width_3 to remove erroneous assertion
- added missing function call to simple_test

1.10 (12 Jul 2001)

- Revised tests to work for both designs of polyhedral surfaces.

1.9 (12 Jul 2001)
- Adapted to new polyhedral surface design (release 3).
- Ported from dd_geo/chull to convex_hull_3.
- Changed to new concept naming convention, i.e., WidthTraits_3.
- Changed traits class to new kernel design naming. However, the unchanged
  member functions make this traits not compliant with kernel traits.
- Edited Width_3.tex quite a bit. Removed redundant descriptions of type
  requirements that are actually described in the WidthTraits_3.

1.8
- Moving to CVS Server and completed truncated text in description.txt

1.7
- To fix the problem with Microsoft Visual C: Replaced all function 
  calls by resolving explicitly all typename's within the signature
  and adding the corresponding class to the list of template
  parameters. There are some functions that have now a dummy data
  access object.
- Some typename's have been replaced by a macro to please Microsoft VC
  compiler.  
- Added 2 typename's within debug regions
- Now test_width_simplex.C is the same in the text directory and the
  test directory

1.6
- Renamed class DA to Data_access to please Windows compilers bcc32
  and CL

1.5
- Lines have been wrapped after 80 chars
- At Line 1402: inserted CGAL:: before DA<...>

1.4.1
- Removed test/basic subdir
