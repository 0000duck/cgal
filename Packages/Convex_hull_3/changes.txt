2.17    (11 July 2001)
- really fixed	demo makefile for Windoze

2.16    (11 July 2001)
- fixed degenerate quickhull test so it generates precise numbers instead
  of doubles
- added some missing typenames
- modified quickhull to get rid of use of normalize_border (faster and less
  obscure set of requirements for the polyhedron) 
- fixed demo makefile for Windoze

2.15    (27 June 2001)
- removed use of hash_map and replaced with CGAL::Hash_map in quickhull
- updated some typenames that were changed in Polyhedron
- added concepts for polyhedron vertex, facet, halfedge
- added examples of incremental and dynamic construction in test and in doc.
- changed name of convex_hull_3_from_d to convex_hull_incremental_3

2.14    (23 June 2001)
- fixed doc. problem

2.13    (21 June 2001)
- fixed bugs with facet circulator 
- removed predicates that are now in kernel traits

2.12    (19 June 2001)
- incorporated changes to work for new polyhedron design

2.11    (19 June 2001)
- removed dd_geo directory

2.10    (1 June 2001)
- fixed number type conversion in centroid predicate
- added some missing typenames
- fixed doc. problems

2.9     (24 May 2001)
- added test programs for new quickhull 3D

2.8     (24 May 2001)
- fixed paths to example code in doc.
- changed name of subdirectories from ConvexHull3D to Convex_hull_3


2.7     (22 May 2001)

- added doc_tex directory with new documentation style.
- changed convex_hull_3 to use the new quickhull implementation.
- replaced use of dd_geo extension package with Michael Seel's 
  d-dim. convex hull code with d = 3; implemented as function
  convex_hull_3_from_d.

2.6     (21 Aug 2000)

- typenames in chull.C's d3_surface_map used for CHTRAITS::IPOINT
  and CHTRAITS::PLANE; this makes the CGAL_TYPENAME_MSVC_NULL obsolete
  (see 2.5) and fixes a Borland problem

2.5     (09 Aug 2000)

- typename in chull.C replaced by CGAL_TYPENAME_MSVC_NULL
  (as suggested by Dima)
- unused variable edge elast "removed"

2.4     (14 Jul 2000)

- fixed a bug in chull::d3_surface_map() (for a set of coplanar points)
  which caused a bug in convex_hull_3() (reported by Matthias) 

2.3     (01 Feb 2000)

- CGAL_const_cast replaced by const_cast<>

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%   R e l e a s e  2 . 1   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

2.2.2 -> 2.2.3  (10 Dec 99)
- typename removed in _test_cls_chull_traits.C with std::vector<Point>

2.2.1 -> 2.2.2  (03 Dec 99)
- typename added in chull_traits (detected by  -pedantic)

2.2   -> 2.2.1  (12 Nov 99)
- return 0; added to int main() in manual_example.C

2.1   -> 2.2    (05 Oct 99)
- _test_cls_chull_traits_3.C: using std::vector removed; std::vector used;
- CGAL_TYPENAME_MSVC_NULL in chull.h with default template arguments

2.0.6 -> 2.1    (01 Oct 99)
- missing file convex_hull_3.h added to package again

2.0.5 -> 2.0.6  (29 Sep 99)
- modified makefile to use CGAL_WINDOW_FLAGS

2.0.4 -> 2.0.5  (01 Sep 99)
- removed test/makefile

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%   R e l e a s e  2 . 0   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

2.0.3 -> 2.0.4  (28 Apr 99)
- added workaround for LEDA::before to dd_geo, LEDA_PREFIXLI

2.0.2 -> 2.0.3  (28 Apr 99)
- fixed a bug in submission scripts

2.0.1 -> 2.0.2  (30 Mar 99)
- to_double() prefixed by CGAL::

2.0   -> 2.0.1  (22 Mar 99)
- name conflict for orientation in chull_traits_[23] resolved by 'prefixing'
  calls of orientation() with CGAL::   (egcs didn't complain, but produced 
  a segmentation fault - egcs should be less fault-tolerant! )

1.1.3 -> 2.0    (22 Mar 99)
- namespace CGAL introduced

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%   R e l e a s e  1 . 2   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

1.1.2 -> 1.1.3
- WINDOW_LDFLAGS added in test/ConvexHull3D/makefile

1.1.1 -> 1.1.2
- DDGEO_STL_ITERATORS always undefined (since it works for g++/egcs,
  but not with SunPro 4.2 nor with mips 7.2.

1.1 -> 1.1.1
- LONG_NAME_PROBLEM_[CXX|LD]FLAGS added to makefile in testsuite

1.0 -> 1.1
- added workaround for a problem with forall_nodes - loops and prefixing 
  in LEDA prior to 3.6.2 (= current beta-version of LEDA at MPI).
  examples/manual_example.C now compiles with 3.6.1 as well.
