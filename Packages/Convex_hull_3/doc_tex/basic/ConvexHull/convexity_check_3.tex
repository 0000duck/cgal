There are also functions for checking the validity of the computed convex
hull in three dimensions.  For the function \ccc{convex_hull_3_from_d}, this is 
provided through the \ccc{is_valid} member function of the class 
\ccc{CGAL::Convex_hull_d}.
The function \ccc{is_strongly_convex_3}\ccIndexMainItem[C]{is_strongly_convex_3}
uses the algorithm of Mehlhorn \textit{et al.} \cite{mnssssu-cgpvg-96}
to determine if the vertices of a given polyhedron constitute a strongly
convex point set ot not.  This is tested as a postcondition of the function
\ccc{convex_hull_3}\ccIndexSubitem[C]{convex_hull_3}{postcondition}.
