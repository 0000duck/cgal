There are also functions for checking the validity of the computed 3-
or $d$-dimensional convex hull.  These functions use the algorithm of
Mehlhorn \textit{et al.} \cite{mnssssu-cgpvg-96} to determine if the
vertices of a given hull constitute a strongly convex point set or not.
For three dimensions, this is provided via the function 
\ccc{is_strongly_convex_3}\ccIndexMainItem[C]{is_strongly_convex_3}, which
is used in postcondition testing of the function
\ccc{convex_hull_3}\ccIndexSubitem[C]{convex_hull_3}{postcondition}.  
In $d$ dimensions, the functionality is provided through the \ccc{is_valid}
member function of the class \ccc{CGAL::Convex_hull_d}.
