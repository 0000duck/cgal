\section{3D Convex Hull}
\begin{ccPackage}{convex hull, 3D}

There are two functions provided for computing convex hulls in three 
dimensions.  The function 
\ccc{convex_hull_3}\ccIndexMainItem[C]{convex_hull_3} provides an 
implementation of the quickhull algorithm \cite{bdh-qach-96} for three 
dimensions\ccIndexMainItem{quickhull, 3D}.  There are two versions of this
function available, one that can be used when it is known that the output
will be a polyhedron (\textit{i.e.}, there are more than three points and
they are not all collinear) and one that handles all degenerate cases
and returns a \ccc{CGAL::Object}, which may be a point, a segment, a
triangle, or a polyhedron.

The function \ccc{convex_hull_3_from_d}\ccIndexMainItem[C]{convex_hull_3_from_d}
provides an interface that produces a polyhedron as output and uses the
d-dimensional randomized incremental construction algorithm.  This function
does not have a traits class in its interface as it uses the representation
class \ccc{R} used in the polyhedron type to define an instance of the 
adapter traits class \ccc{CGAL::Convex_hull_d_traits_3<R>}.
