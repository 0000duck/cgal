demo/Convex_hull_3/README
-------------------------

This demo program illustrates the 3D version of the quickhull algorithm.
The user supplies a non-negative integer value indicating the number 
of points to be generated.  The points are drawn randomly from a sphere
of a certain radius and the resulting hull of the points is displayed 
in a Geomview window. 

To compile the program, you may use the provided make file.
