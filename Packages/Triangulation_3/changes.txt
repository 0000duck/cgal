test suite modified for regular triangulation

Version 1.12 (23 sept 99)
Facet_circulator added
changes in the internal representation of Cell_circulator

Version 1.11 (17 sept 99)
trying new special macro for MSVC typename bug

Version 1.10 (15 sept 99)
a few more typenames in Regular triangulation
a few more std:: in the test suite

Version 1.9 (13 sept 99)
minor changes (names, etc)
minor changes in the doc (macros, not change in the contents)

Version 1.8 (8 sept 99)

regular triangulations added
+ cleaning

Version 1.3 (13 July 99)
include files :
	Some cleaning +
	The constructors of the cells do not insert the cell in the
	triangulation any more. Instead the triangulation has functions
	to add cells. (for data structure and geometric triangulation as well)
doc :
	Several small corrections + updates due to the changes in include files.	
test-suite :
	updates due to the changes in include files +
	does not always call gmp
