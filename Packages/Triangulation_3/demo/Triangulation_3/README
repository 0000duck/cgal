------- demo -------------------------------------------------
(this is an elementary demo, a nice one should come in the future)

Construction of a Delaunay triangulation.

Needs an input file "data/points" containing points (given by x y z)

Opens a geomview window
[see the chapter Geomview in the cgal manual - support library:
Geomview 1.8.1 is required.
Important: The last line in the startup file .geomview must be (echo
"started"). The two commands rsh and Geomview must be in the user's
path, otherwise the program will not be able to execute.]

Draws the triangulation (vertices and edges) in geomview

Locates a point a shows the cell containing it

Draws the triangulation (edges and cells) in geomview,
then the user can move one of the two displayed versions
of the triangulation.

This demo program uses "doubles". 
For a robust version, CGAL::Filtered_exact<double, CGAL::MP_Float> 
should be used.
