demo
------------
Construction of a Delaunay triangulation.

Needs an input file "data" containing points (given by x y z)

Opens a geomview window
Draws the triangulation in geomview
Writes the triangulation into a file "output"

This demo program uses "doubles". 
For a robust version, another arithmetic should be used.
