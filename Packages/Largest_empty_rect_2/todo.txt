- Remove the polygon stuff
- add default constructor + init method, copy constructor, assignment
- Remove these 0.000001 constants
- Check if the lengthy name problem is still an issue
- Why does the Delete function object not compile???
- Do we also want to offer functions left(), right(), top(), bottom() ???
- The four auxiliary points behave strange: 
  * They are enumerated with begin(), end()
  * They can delimit a rectangle
  although they are not known to  the user.
  Can we identify the additional points via their Point_data pointer??
- Shouldn't we check wether inserted points are inside the initial bounding box?
- Find a better name for method get_bounding_box.
- Shall we sto tre the iso-rectangle passed in the constructor
  in order to return the one that was passed to the constructor
  instead of a new one
