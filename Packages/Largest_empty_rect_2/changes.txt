Version 1.3 (16 May 01) [af]
- removed get_list_of_points
- replaced NT x, y by Point_2 in nested class Point_data
- replaced all comparison functions with the ones from the kernel
- changed Point_tpye: capitalized the type and uppercased the value constants
- Moved the enum Point_type into class scope
- Moved .h file in subdirectory ./include/CGAL, 
  so that one can #include<CGAL/Largest_empty_iso_rectangle_2.h>
- Changed filename EmptyRect.h to Largest_empty_iso_rectangle_2.h
- Removed the public_set. The set x_sorted also does it. 
  Used iterator adaptors to get Point_2 as value type.
