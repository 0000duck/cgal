A structure that supports 2D arrangements. The data structure maintains a
planar map and curve hierarchy trees. Given a collection C of planar curves,
the arrangement A(c) is the partition of the plane to vertices, edges and faces
induced by the curves of C.
	
The package contains the Arrangement header files, default traits classes, 
dcel class, examples, and a demo directory with a graphic demo.
