\section{Planar Map with Intersections Reference Pages}

\subsection*{Introduction}
\ccRefLabel{pmwx_ref_intro}

  The \ccc{Planar Map with Intersections} package extends the
  functionality of the \ccc{Planar Map} package. Morover, the class
  \ccc{Planar_map_with_intersections_2} extends the class
  \ccc{Planar_map_2}. The \ccc{Planar Map with Intersections} package
  supports insertion functions that handle non $x$-monotone curves and
  intersections and overlappings among the curves of the planar
  map. The basic types of the \ccc{Planar Map} package (vertex,
  halfedge, face, Dcel, etc.) are
  kept. \ccc{Planar_map_with_intersections_2} is templated with the
  planar map class it derives from.

\subsection*{Planar Map with Intersections Traits Class}
%-----------------------------------------------
  Since the planar map with intersections has an additional
  functionality of handling non $x$-monotone and intersecting curves
  it needs additional functionality of the traits class. We describe
  the \ccc{PlanarMapwithIntersectionsTraits_2} concept following in
  this chapter. 

  %Nevertheless, we do not have specific implementation
  %of this concept, and we use models of the \ccc{ArrangementTraits_2}
  %concept, which is a refinement thereof instead (see
  %Chapter~\ref{I1_ChapterArrangement}).

\subsection*{Sweep line:}
The construction of a \ccc{Planar map} can be done using a sweep
line technique rather than iteratively inserting one curve after another.
The sweep line algorithm perfomrs better, but is done statically and therefore
requires the list of curves in advance.
Due to the sweep line technique, inserting curves which are interior intersect, 
overlap or non $x$-monotone is supported.
The interface is given in chapter  ~\ref{I1_ChapterPlanarMap}.

\subsection*{Change Notification}
%-----------------------------------------------
An insertion of an intersecting curve to a planar map may add
several halfedges and modify several features of the map (i.e.,
split halfedges, split faces). The relevant function of the change
notification instance, that is passed to the modification methods
of a planar map with intersections, is called after each such
modification. The change notification class is useful in many
cases. For example, one may add a color (or other extra data) to
any halfedge of a planar map. An insertion of a new curve can
split halfedges that were previously in the map. After such split
the color of the newly created halfedges should be updated
according to the original color of the split halfedge. One can do
this by implementing the \ccc{split_edge} function of the change
notification class. This function will be called after each split
of an halfedge in the map.


\subsubsection{Example of Change Notification}
\label{ssecn:example2}
The following example demonstrates the usage of the change
notification concept during the construction of a
planar map out of three segments --- $(0,1)-(1,0)$, $(0,0)-(1,1)$
and $(0,1)-(1,1)$.
During the insertion we use \ccc{My_notification} instance to
output the internal process of the construction of the planar map.
We also count how many edges are in the map by incrementing a
counter each time an edge is added (\ccc{add_edge})or
split (\ccc{split_edge}).

\ccIncludeExampleCode{Pm_with_intersections/example2.C}

The output of the program looks like this:
\begin{verbatim}
inserting 0 1 1 0
add_edge
add_hole
inserting 0 0 1 1
split_edge
add_edge
add_edge
inserting 0 1 1 1
add_edge
split_face
Total number of edges 5
\end{verbatim}
