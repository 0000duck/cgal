\chapter{2D Arrangements} \label{I1_ChapterArrangement_2}

\section{Introduction}

Given a collection $C$ of (possibly
intersecting and not necessarily $x$-monotone) curves in the plane,
we construct a collection 
$C''$ in two steps: First we decompose each curve in $C$ into maximal
$x$-monotone curves, thus obtaining the collection $C'$. We then
decompose each curve in $C'$ into maximal connected pieces not
intersecting any other curve in $C'$. This way we obtain the
collection $C''$ of $x$-monotone, pairwise interior-disjoint curves.
The {\em arrangement} of the curves in $C$ is the
{\it planar map} (see Chapter~\ref{I1_ChapterPlanarMap})
induced by the curves in $C''$.

\section{Software Design}
 
The class \ccc{CGAL::Arrangement_2<Dcel,Traits,Base_node>} is a data
structure for maintaining 2D arrangements. The data structure
maintains a planar map and curve hierarchy trees. There is a curve
tree for each curve inserted into the arrangement (see below). The
underlying combinatorial structure is determined by the
\ccc{Dcel} template parameter, which should be a model of the
\ccc{ArrangementDcel_2} concept. The family of curves of the
arrangement is determined by the \ccc{Traits} template parameter which
should be a model of the \ccc{ArrangementTraits_2} concept. The
\ccc{Base_node} template parameter defines the attributes associated
with each tree node of the hierarchy tree.

\paragraph{Curve Hierarchy Tree:} When constructing an arrangement
we decompose each curve $c$ in two steps obtaining the collections
$c'$ and $c''$. We regard these collections as levels in a hierarchy
of curves where the union of the subcurves in each level is the
original curve $c$. We store these collections in a special structure
--- a {\em hierarchy tree}. This structure usually consists of three
levels, although in some cases they can consist of less (e.g., when
inserting an $x$-monotone curve) or more (when the users define their
own {\em split functions} see Section~\ref{ssec:example4}). The levels
are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Curve node level: the root of the tree --- holds the original curve.
\item Subcurve node level: inner nodes of the tree --- hold decomposed
subcurves of
the original curve. In the default mode these are $x$-monotone curves.
\item Edge node level: leaves of the tree --- hold the curves corresponding to
the edges of the planar map induced by the arrangement. These nodes will
be built only in {\em update mode} (by default the arrangement is in
update mode).
\end{itemize}

Figure~\ref{fig:hierarchy} shows an example of a simple arrangement and its 
corresponding curve hierarchy.

\end{figure}

The hierarchy tree enables us to intersect the curves without loss of
information. The original curve and the intermediate subcurves are stored
in the tree and the user can traverse them. Furthermore, the users can
define their own hierarchy by passing their own intersection sequence.
This can be of use in some applications. For example, in an arrangement
of spline curves the users might want to intersect a curve in the
junction points before making the curve $x$-monotone. 

\paragraph{Degeneracies} Like the planar map package (see
Chapter~\ref{I1_ChapterPlanarMap}), the arrangement package can deal
with $x$-degenerate input (including vertical segments). However,
while in the planar map the input curves were assumed to be
$x$-monotone and non-intersecting in their interiors, there are no
such assumptions in the arrangement. A non $x$-monotone curve is
partitioned into $x$-monotone subcurves, and curves are intersected in
their points of intersection with other points before they are
inserted into the map. Furthermore, overlapping curves are
supported. If two curves overlap the traits intersection function
returns the two endpoints of the common part. Circulators of the
\ccc{Overlap_circulator} type (of
\ccc{Arrangement_2<Dcel,Traits,Base_node>}) enables to traverse all
overlapping \ccc{edge_nodes} that correspond to the same pair of
halfedges in the map.

\paragraph{I/O functions:}
I/O functions for reading a saved arrangement from the standard input, 
writing it to the standard output or drawing it to a graphic stream are also provided.
Users of I/O functions for the arrangement package are required to define I/O 
operators for the curves defined in their \ccc{Traits} classes.

\paragraph{Update Mode:} For some algorithms, it is not necessary to build
the whole planar map induced by the arrangement. For example, the lower
envelope of an arrangement of $x$-monotone curves that intersect
each other at most a fixed constant number of $s$ times,
can be found in near linear time \cite{sa-dsstg-95, h-a-97}
even if
the complexity of the planar map induced by it is quadratic.
Therefore, building the planar map induced by the arrangement is not
always desired. The users can therefore disable (or postpone) the building
of the planar map. This is done by disabling the {\it update mode}
using the \ccc{set_update(bool)} member function. When update mode is
set to \ccc{true}, the planar map is updated --- this is the
default situation. 
When update mode is set to \ccc{false}, the hierarchy tree is built without
its \ccc{Edge_level}, and the curves are not inserted into the planar map.

%\section{Example Programs}
%---------------------------------------------------
\section{Segment Arrangements}

The second template parameter of the arrangement class determines the
so-called geometry of the arrangement, that is the family of curves we
want to deal with. In order to deal with line segments we simply plug
in on of the two segment traits classes supplied.

The \ccc{Arr_segment_exact_traits<R>} class is generic and allows
flexibility in determining the kernel which is used. The
\ccc{Arr_leda_segments_exact_traits<R>} is specialized to use \leda\/'s
\ccc{geometric rational kernel} and works with \leda\/'s rational
numbers. It has better performance.

\subsection{Example of an Arrangement of Segments}
The following example demonstrates the construction of an $X$-shaped
arrangement out of two segments.  After the construction we traverse
the edges of the arrangement in the order defined by the original
segments.

The four numbers on each output lines is a representation of a segment.
The first two numbers are the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the first endpoint.
The other two numbers are of the second endpoint. The way a curve is
printed depends on the the output operator implemented for it.

\ccIncludeExampleCode{Arrangement_2/example1.C}

The output of the program looks like this:
\begin{verbatim}
Curve level:
0 0 1 1
Edge level:
0 0 0.5 0.5
0.5 0.5 1 1

Curve level:
0 1 1 0
Edge level:
0 1 0.5 0.5
0.5 0.5 1 0
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Example of Overlapping Segments}
\label{ssec:example2}
The following example demonstrates the construction of an
arrangement out of two overlapping segments --- $(0,0)-(2,2)$
and $(1,1)-(3,3)$.
After the insertion of the segments we
traverse the halfedges
of the arrangement and count the overlapping curves.
This is done using the \ccc{overlap_edges()} member function that returns an
\ccc{Overlap_circulator}. With it we can circulate
over all the edge nodes that correspond to the halfedge.

\ccIncludeExampleCode{Arrangement_2/example2.C}

The output of the program looks like this:
\begin{verbatim}
Edge 0 0 1 1 is covered by a single edge.
Edge 1 1 2 2 is covered by 2 edges.
Edge 2 2 3 3 is covered by a single edge.
\end{verbatim}

\section{Arrangements with Circular Arcs}

There is a traits class for circular arcs
(\ccc{Arr_circle_real_traits<NT>}) and a traits class for both
circular arcs \ccc{and} line segments
(\ccc{Arr_segment_circle_traits<NT>}, which can be use, e.g., in
motion planning applications. These traits classes expect a number type
that supports the square root operation.

\subsection{Example of an Arrangement of Circular Arcs}
\label{ssec:example3}
The following example demonstrates the use of the circle traits.
The arrangement created by this example is depicted in
Figure~\ref{fig:circles}.
For this simple example the built-in double
number type will run correctly, it is {\em not} recommended
in the general case. 
The traits are robust only when used with a
number type that supports exact \ccc{sqrt} operations such as LEDA real number type (requires LEDA to be installed
in order to run).

\section{Polyline Arrangements}

There are two supplied traits classes for polyline (a.k.a.,
poly-segment) curves (\ccc{Arr_polyline_traits<R, Container>} and
\ccc{Arr_leda_polyline_traits<Container>}).

\subsection{Example of a Polyline Arrangement}
\label{ssec:example10}
The following example demonstrates the use of the polyline traits.
Observe that a polyline Curve is a container (the default STL in this case).
Note that a polyline point is not necessarily  a vertex of the arrangement 
(that is, of the underlying Planar Map).
An edge of the Planar Map need not be a segment (recall the circle traits 
in the above example). The edges are only required to be x-monotone and pairwise disjoint. However, one might expect the planar map (or rather the edge level of the arrangement) to be made of segments alone. 
In the example below point (150, 50) is not a vertex of the planar map. 
The polyline to which it belongs is an edge of the planar map. In such cases the user can define additional level of hierarchies, as shown in the next example.

For this simple example the built-in double
number type will run correctly, it is {\em not} recommended
in the general case. 
The traits are robust only when used with a
number type such as LEDA real number type (requires LEDA to be installed
in order to run).

\section{User-defined Hierarchy}

The default hierarchy structure can be extended to include more levels
according to user defined split functions.

\subsection{Example of a User-defined Hierarchy}
\label{ssec:example4}

The following example demonstrates the construction of an
arrangement of two segments, using a user-defined
hierarchy.
We use a simple split function that splits a segment in its middle
point. We insert the first segment using the user-defined function
and the second segment with the regular function.

\ccIncludeExampleCode{Arrangement_2/example4.C}

The output of the program looks like this:
\begin{verbatim}
Curve level:
0 0 6 6
Edge level:
0 0 3 3
3 3 4 4
4 4 6 6

Curve level:
0 4 6 4
Edge level:
0 4 4 4
4 4 6 4
\end{verbatim}

\end{ccAdvanced}


\begin{ccAdvanced}

\subsection{Example of a User-defined Hierarchy with Function Objects}
\label{ssec:example5}

The following example demonstrates the use of a function object in
a user-defined hierarchy. We define a base class for the function objects
with a virtual \ccc{operator()}, that the function objects override (this
kind of pattern is sometimes called an \ccc{Action} class
(see for example \cite[Chapter~25.5]{s-cpl-97}). This enables us to
use an inner state in our function as is done in the example.

In the example we define two levels of a hierarchy. The first level
splits the inserted segment in the middle. The second layer splits every
curve of the first layer in a ratio of $1/3 : 2/3$. Therefore, after
an insertion of the segment $(0,0) - (6,6)$
we will have four edges (eight halfedges)
inside the arrangement, corresponding to the segments: $(0,0) - (1,1)$,
$(1,1) - (3,3)$, $(3,3) - (4,4)$ and $(4,4) - (6,6)$.
