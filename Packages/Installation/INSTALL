$(CGAL_HOME)/INSTALL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file describes how to install CGAL on Unix or Unix-like systems
such as Linux, Solaris, Irix, and Cygwin on Windows. For installation
under Windows using native tools, see INSTALL.win32.

The documentation of CGAL is available in various formats (HTML, PostScript,
PDF). It is not bundled with the software but can be downloaded separately.

For more information about CGAL, see the URL http://www.cgal.org/.

To install CGAL, you should:

  - download the compressed archive file from the CGAL web site www.cgal.org

  - unpack the file in the place in which you wish to install it

  - follow the directions in the Installation notes. 
    These are available in several formats. A PostScript file named
    installation.ps.gz can be found in the directory doc_ps. 
    The HTML version is in doc_html/installation/main.html.

The programs in the demos directory provide visual output.  Most of these
use the CGAL::Window_stream, which is currently provided via the LEDA library. 
If you have LEDA installed you need do nothing more than compile CGAL with LEDA
support to be able to use the Window_stream and thus run these demo programs.

Because LEDA is no longer available for free for academic use, we have made 
arrangements with Algorithmic Solutions Software, GmbH, the distributors of 
LEDA, to provide a separate CGALwin library for those who do not have LEDA 
installed. This library is based on the LEDA window but is available for 
download independently of LEDA from the CGAL download page.  It is available 
in binary form only and only for academic research and teaching use. 

This binary should be installed in the directory containing the CGAL library,
which is created when the library is installed. 
This directory will be called $(CGAL_HOME)/lib/<os_compiler> 
(e.g., /usr/local/CGAL-2.3/lib/sparc_SunOS-5.8_g++-2.95.3 or
/cygdrive/D/CGAL-2.3/lib/i686_CYGWINNT-5.0-1.3.2_bcc32.exe-5.5.1).  

If you do not find a binary form there that works on your system, contact 
us at contact@cgal.org, and we will try to accommodate your needs.

Demo programs for 3D structures require the geomview program for visualisation.
This is available from www.geomview.org.
