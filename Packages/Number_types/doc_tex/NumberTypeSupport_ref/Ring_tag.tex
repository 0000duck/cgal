\begin{ccRefClass} {Ring_tag}

\ccDefinition

The class \ccRefName\ is used as a tag in some algorithms. It
indicates that a number type is to be considered as a model for
RingNumberType. Only operations defined for RingNumberType are used.
For example, no divisions are computed, even if the number type as
such supports divisions.
