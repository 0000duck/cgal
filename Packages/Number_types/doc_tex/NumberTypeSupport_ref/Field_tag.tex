\begin{ccRefClass} {Field_tag}

\ccDefinition

The class \ccRefName\ is used as a tag in some algorithms. It
indicates that a number type is to be considered as a model for
FieldNumberType. Only operations defined for FieldNumberType are used.
For example, no squareroot operations are computed, even if the number
type as such supports squareroots.
