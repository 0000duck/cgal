\chapter{Number Type Support}\label{Numbertype}

\cgal\ representation classes are parameterized by number types.  
Depending on the problem and the input data that have to be handled,
one has to make a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy in 
order to select an appropriate number type and representation class.

In homogeneous representation, two number types are involved,
although only one of them appears as a template parameter in
the homogeneous representation class.
This type, for sake of simplicity and readability called ring type is
used for the representation of homogeneous coordinates and all 
internal computations. 
If it is assured that the second operand divides the first one, these 
internal computations are basically division-free.
The ring type is a placeholder for an integer type (or an integral 
domain type) rather than for elements of arbitrary rings. 
The name should remind you that the division operation is not
really needed (with the exception mentioned above) for this number type.
Of course, also more general number types can be used as a ring type 
in a homogeneous representation class. In some computations, e.g.\ accessing 
Cartesian coordinates, divisions cannot be avoided. In these computations a 
second number type, the field type, is used. \cgal\ automatically generates 
this number type as a \ccStyle{Quotient}\ccTexHtml{, 
cf.\ Subsection~\ref{Quotient}}{}. For the Cartesian representation 
there is only one number type that is used for all calculations.

The representation classes provide access to the number types 
involved in the representation, although it is not expected that
such access is needed at this level, since low-level geometric 
operations are wrapped in geometric primitives provided by \cgal.
This access can be useful if appropriate primitives are missing.
In a homogeneous representation class \ccStyle{R} ring type and field
type can be accessed as \ccStyle{R::RT} and \ccStyle{R::FT}, respectively.
The number type used in Cartesian representation is considered as 
ring type and as field type depending on the context.
If can be accessed as \ccStyle{R::RT} and \ccStyle{R::FT}, according
to the use of number types used in the homogeneous counterpart.

\section{Required Functionality of Number Types\label{nt-requirements}}
Number types must fulfill certain requirements, such that they can
be successfully used in \cgal\ code.
This section describes those requirements.
We focus on the syntactical requirements. Of course, number types also
have evident semantic constraints. They should be meaningful in the
sense that they approximate the integers or the rationals 
or some other subfield of the real numbers.

The requirements are described as a class interface of a class \ccStyle{NT}, 
with constructors, methods and the like. 
This is only a matter of presentation.  
In fact \ccc{double} and \ccc{float} also fulfill the requirements.

\begin{ccClass} {NT}
\ccSetTwoColumns{}{\hspace*{8.5cm}}
\ccCreation
\ccCreationVariable{ntvar}

\ccConstructor{NT();}
	    {Declaration of a variable.}


\ccConstructor{NT(const NT &ntval);}
	    {Declaration and initialization.}


\ccConstructor{NT(i)}
	    {Declaration and initialization with a small integer
constant $i$, $0 \leq i \leq 127$. The neutral elements for addition
(zero) and multiplication (one) are needed quite often, but sometimes
other small constants are useful too. The value 127 was chosen such
that even signed 8 bit number types can fulfill this condition.  }

\ccSetThreeColumns{XXXXXX}{}{\hspace*{8.5cm}}
\ccOperations
\ccMethod{NT & operator=(const NT &ntval);}
        {Assignment.  }


\ccFunction{bool is_valid(const NT &ntval);}
{Not all values of a number type need be valid. The routine
\ccStyle{is_valid} checks this. For example, an expression like
\ccStyle{NT(0)/NT(0)} can result in an invalid number. Routines often
have as a precondition that all numerical values are valid.}

\ccFunction{bool is_finite(const NT &ntval);}
{ When two large values are multiplied, the result may not fit in a
  \ccStyle{NT}. 
  Some number types (the standard \ccc{float} and \ccc{double} type
  when they conform to standards) have a way to represent a too big
  value as infinity.  \ccStyle{is_finite} implies \ccStyle{is_valid}.}

\ccMethod{bool operator==(const NT &n) const;}
       {}
\ccGlue
\ccMethod{bool operator!=(const NT &n) const;}
       {}
\ccGlue
\ccMethod{bool operator<(const NT &n) const;}
       {}
\ccGlue
\ccMethod{bool operator>(const NT &n) const;}
       {}
\ccGlue
\ccMethod{bool operator<=(const NT &n) const;}
       {}
\ccGlue
\ccMethod{bool operator>=(const NT &n) const;}
       {}
\ccGlue
\ccFunction{NT operator+(const NT &ntval1, const NT &ntval2);}
       {}
\ccGlue
\ccMethod{NT operator+=(const NT &n) const;}
       {}
\ccGlue
\ccFunction{NT operator-(const NT &ntval1, const NT &ntval2);}
       {}
\ccGlue
\ccMethod{NT operator-=(const NT &n) const;}
       {}
\ccGlue
\ccFunction{NT operator*(const NT &ntval1, const NT &ntval2);}
       {}
\ccGlue
\ccMethod{NT operator*=(const NT &n) const;}
       {}
\ccGlue
\ccFunction{NT operator-(const NT &ntval);}
       {}

\ccFunction{double to_double(const NT &ntval);}
         {gives the double value for a number type.
          This is usually an approximation for the real (stored) value.
          It can be used to send numbers to a renderer or to store them 
          in a file.}


\ccFunction{NT operator/(const NT &ntval1, const NT &ntval2);}
       {}
\ccGlue
\ccMethod{NT operator/=(const NT &n) const;}
       {%Division is not required for a ring type.
   Division by zero need not be defined. It may result in a runtime error, an
   invalid value, a valid value or anything else. This basically means that the
   library tests for zero whenever it does a division.}

%If I/O-stream operators are defined for number type \ccc{NT}, 
%the following function should be defined as well:
%
%\ccFunction{io_Operator io_tag(const NT &);}
%        {}


\section{Utility Routines}

The previous section listed all the required functionality.
For the user of a number type it is handy to have a larger set of
operations available.

\subsection{Utility Functions}
\ccSetThreeColumns{Comparison_result}{}{\hspace*{6cm}}

\ccInclude{CGAL/number_utils.h}

\ccFunction{NT min(const NT& ntval1, const NT& ntval2);}
{returns the smaller of the two values.}
\ccGlue
\ccFunction{NT max(const NT& ntval1, const NT& ntval2);}
{returns the larger of the two values.}
\ccGlue
\ccFunction{NT abs(const NT& ntval);}
{returns the absolute value.}
\ccGlue
\ccFunction{NT square(const NT& ntval);}
{returns the square of \ccc{ntval}.}
\ccGlue
\ccFunction{Sign sign(const NT& ntval);}
{returns the sign: \ccc{POSITIVE}, \ccc{ZERO}, or \ccc{NEGATIVE}.}
\ccGlue
\ccFunction{bool is_negative(const NT& ntval);}
{}
\ccGlue
\ccFunction{bool is_positive(const NT& ntval);}
{}
\ccGlue
\ccFunction{bool is_zero(const NT& ntval);}
{}
\ccGlue
\ccFunction{bool is_one(const NT& ntval);}
{}
\ccGlue
\ccFunction{Comparison_result compare(const NT &n1, const NT &n2);}
{returns \ccc{GREATER} iff $n1>n2$, \ccc{EQUAL} iff $n1=n2$, and \ccc{SMALLER} iff $n1<n2$.}

Those routines are implemented using the required operations from the
previous section. They are defined by means of templates, so you do not
have to supply all those operations when you write  a new number type.
But if you have a better implementation for any of them, you can provide a 
corresponding overloading function with the same name for your number types,
which will get preference over the template functions listed above.

For the number types \ccc{int}, and \ccc{double} there is
the random numbers generator \ccc{Random}.

%\ccInclude{CGAL/basic.h}

%\ccFunction{template <class NT> bool is_even( NT x);}
%    {returns $(i \;\&\; 1) == 0$.}

%\ccFunction{template <class NT> bool is_odd( NT x);}
%    {returns $(i \;\&\; 1) == 1$.}

\end{ccClass} 

\subsection{Utility Function Classes}
In addition to the utility routines listed above, 
there are function object class templates corresponding to these functions.
Note that the function object class corresponding to \ccc{sign} is
named \ccc{Sgn} in order to avoid a conflict with the type 
\ccc{Sign}.

\cgal\ provides the following function object classes:

\ccInclude{CGAL/number_utils_classes.h}

\ccc{class Min<NT>;}\\
\ccc{class Max<NT>;}\\
\ccc{class Abs<NT>;}\\
\ccc{class Sgn<NT>;}\\
\ccc{class Is_negative<NT>;}\\
\ccc{class Is_positive<NT>;}\\
\ccc{class Is_zero<NT>;}\\
\ccc{class Is_one<NT>;}\\
\ccc{class Compare<NT>;}

\section{Built-in Number Types}

The built-in number types \ccc{float} and \ccc{double} have the
required arithmetic and comparison operators. They lack some required
routines though which are automatically included by \cgal.
\ccTexHtml{\footnote{ The functions can be found in the header files 
\ccc{<CGAL/double.h>} and \ccc{<CGAL/float.h>}.}}{}

All built-in number types of \CC\ can represent a discrete (bounded)
subset of the rational numbers only.  We assume that the
floating-point arithmetic of your machine follows {\sc Ieee}
floating-point standard.  Since the floating-point culture has much
more infrastructural support (hardware, language definition and
compiler) than exact computation, it is very efficient.
Like with all number types with finite precision representation
which are used as approximations to the infinite ranges of 
integers or real numbers, the built-in number types are inherently
potentially inexact.
Be aware of this if you decide to use the efficient built-in 
number types: you have to cope with numerical problems.  
For example, you can compute the intersection point of two lines and 
then check whether this point lies on the two lines. 
%With exact arithmetic, the check will always return \ccc{true}. 
With floating point arithmetic,
roundoff errors may cause the answer of the check to be \ccc{false}. 
With the built-in integer types overflow might occur.

\section{Number Types Provided by \leda}
\label{leda-nt}

\leda\ provides number types that can be used for exact computation 
with both Cartesian and homogeneous representations.  If you are using
homogeneous representation with the built-in integer types
\ccc{short}, \ccc{int}, and \ccc{long} as ring type, exactness of
computations can be guaranteed only if your input data come from a
sufficiently small integral range and the depth of the computations is
sufficiently small.  \leda\ provides the number type \ccc{leda_integer} for
integers of arbitrary length. (Of course the length is
somehow bounded by the resources of your computer.)  It can be used as
ring type in homogeneous representation and leads to exact
computation as long as all intermediate results are rational.  For the
same kind of problems Cartesian representation with number type
\ccc{leda_rational} leads to exact computation as well.
The number type \ccc{leda_bigfloat} in \leda\ is a variable precision
floating-point type. Rounding mode and precision (i.e.\ mantissa length) of
\ccc{leda_bigfloat} can be set. 

The most sophisticated number type in \leda\ is the number type called
\ccc{leda_real}. Like in Pascal, where the name \ccc{real} is used for
floating-point numbers, the name \ccc{leda_real} does not describe the
number type precisely, but intentionally.  
\ccc{leda_reals} are a subset of real algebraic
numbers.  Any integer is \ccc{leda_real} and \ccc{leda_real}s are closed under
the operations $+,-,*,/$ and $k$-th root computation. 
%\ccTexHtml{$\sqrt[k]{\ }$}{k-th root computation}. 
\ccc{leda_real}s guarantee that
all comparisons between expressions involving \ccc{leda_real}s produce the
exact result.

In the include files \ccc{<CGAL/leda_integer.h>}, \ccc{<CGAL/leda_rational.h>}, 
\ccc{<CGAL/leda_bigfloat.h>}, and \ccc{<CGAL/leda_real.h>}, 
the \leda\ types \ccc{leda_integer}, \ccc{leda_rational},
\ccc{leda_bigfloat}, 
and \ccc{leda_real} are made conform to the requirements presented in
Section \ref{nt-requirements}. 
Also, in these files the \leda\ number types are included.
For more details on the number types of \leda\ we refer to the \leda\ 
manual~\cite{mnsu-lum}.

\section{User-supplied Number Types}

You can also use your own number type with the \cgal\ representation
classes, e.g.\  the {\sc BigNum} package \cite{svh-bpepa-89}.
Depending on the arithmetic operations carried out by the algorithms
that you are going to use the number types must fulfill the
requirements from Section \ref{nt-requirements}.
