\begin{ccRefClass} {Euclidean_ring_tag}

\ccDefinition

The class \ccRefName\ is used as a tag in some algorithms. It
indicates that a number type is to be considered as a model for
EuclideanRingNumberType. Only operations defined for
EuclideanRingNumberType are used. For example, no divisions are
computed, even if the number type as such supports divisions.
