Polyhedron_IO Package: Release changes:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3 (18 Jun 2001)

     - Converted files in the demo and example directory to the new design.
     - Fixed geomview problem with polyhedron names.

3.2 (18 Jun 2001)

     - Merged old design files and new design files into one package.
       First internal release of new design. Old design disabled by 
       default. Can be enabled using #define CGAL_USE_POLYHEDRON_DESIGN_ONE
     - Files in the demo and example directory are not yet converted
       to the new design.

3.1 (21 Sep 2000)

     Complete redesign of the HalfedgeDS. Incompatible to previous 
     versions. The design provides much more flexibility and can 
     support planar maps and other data structures more easily. 
     The class interface for CGAL::Polyhedron_3 is pretty much the 
     same, basically only the template parameters have changed. Thus,
     only minor changes in this package. Tested with g++ and MipsPro 7.3.

2.11 (04 Feb 2000)

     Changing CGAL_static_cast to static_cast<> in File_header_OFF.C.

2.10 (20 Dec 1999)

     Replaced std::abort() with CGAL_CLIB_STD::abort in off_bbox.C,
     off_glue.C and off_transform.C.

2.9 (13 Dec 1999)

     Updated to the new namespace macro for clib functions -- 
     CGAL_CLIB_STD.

2.8 (06 Dec 1999)

     Updated demo directory (README, makefile, cgal_test removed).

2.7 (25 Nov 1999)

     std:: added to abort() functions in examples.

2.6 (22 Jun 1999)
     
     'void inline' order changed in IO/binary_file_io.h.

2.5 (29 Apr 1999)

     std::ostream fixed in IO/binary_file_io.h.

2.6 (22 Jun 1999)

     terr_triang fixed. geomview.C renamed to geomview_demo.C.

2.4 (12 Apr 1999)

     Include "cstring" for test.

2.3 (24 Mar 1999)

     Fixes name space for std::isalnum(), std::isdigit(), std::atoi().

2.2 (16 Mar 1999)

     Fixes name space for std::min() and std::max().

2.1 (09 Mar 1999)

     Standard headers, std namespace and CGAL namespace.

1.11 (17 Dec 1998)

     Three examples fixed to work with new header file names and the
     new Triangulation package.

1.10 (08 Oct 1998)

     File_info has been completely integrated into File_header
     and the new File_header_extended. The writer and scanner classes
     are changed to work with this new File_header.
        All examples and demos have been adapted and shortened to
     be more readable.

1.9 (10 Jul 1998)

     Makefile equipped with LONG_NAME workaround.

1.8 (03 Jun 1998)

     A few changes in the doc. Chapter entry in header. Adapted to
     new header file known_bit_size_integers.h and removal of the
     is_odd function.

1.7 (09 Apr 1998)

     Spell checker.

1.6 (02 Apr 1998)

     Bugs fixed in the examples terr_trian.C and triangulation_print_OFF.h.

     Adapted for new CGAL_BIG_ENDIAN flags.

1.4 (19 Mar 1998)

     Include iostream.h in binary_file_io.h.

1.3 (05 Mar 1998)
