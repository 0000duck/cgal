2.20 (2 September 2003)
- Towards an extensible kernel [af]

2.17 (10 August 2003)

- Replace deprecated compare_lexicographically_xy() by compare_xy().

2.15 (27/May 2003)
- fixed order of CGALi namespace in Triangle_2_Triangle_2_do_intersect.h

2.14 (06 May 2003)
- changed Triangle_2_Triangle_2 intersection test

2.13 (12 April 2003)
- Fix MipsPro warning.

2.12 (4 April 2003)
- Brought files in web in sync with changes in include/CGAL

2.11.7 (22 January 2003)
- Fix for new GCC.

2.11.4 (29 October 2002)
- Rename leftturn and co to left_turn and co.
- Make it work with GMP++.

2.11.2 (28 November 2001)
Fixed typo in ray-ray intersection

2.11 (9 October 2001)
Replaced explicit constructions of Object by make_object

2.10.2 (8 October 2001)
Added some more 'typename' keywords to shut up warnings.

2.10.1 (3 October 2001)
Small fixes

2.9 (19 September 2001)
Bbox_2 intersections with line and ray use pimpl idiom and Simple_cartesian.

2.8 (17 July 2001)
Added do_intersect for two circles.

2.7.1 (19 June 2001)
Added a  #endif

2.7 (22 May 2001)
Implemented segment segment intersection without making use of collinear_has_on.

2.6.5 (1 May 2001)
Small change to suppress a warning.

2.6.4 (2 March 2001)
Adapted testfiles slightly (unsetf instead of setf)

2.6.3 (6 July 2000)
+ Added operator== and operator!= to Straight_2_

----
2.6.2 (19 June 2000)
+ Qualified calls of 'abs' and 'sign' by CGAL_NTS.

----
2.6.1 (18 May 2000)
+ Qualified calls of sign with CGAL::

----
2.6 (17 Apr 2000)
+ Made a few chnges to Straight_2.

-----
2.5.3 (12 April 2000)
+ Changed leading underscores in trailing underscores.

-----
* 2.5.2 *
+ Added CGAL:: prefix before do_intersect in test program; MSVC does not
  have Koenig lookup and needs it.

-----
* 2.5.1 *
+ Removed a number of unneccessary break statements in
  Segment_2_Segment_2_intersection.h

-----
* 2.5 *
+ Altered implementation of do_intersect for segment segment case.
  This version is much faster (factor 20 to 30 with Cartesian<double>)
  and is accurate when the segment is degenerated to a point.

-----
* 2.4 *
+ Replaced const casting by mutable keyword.

-----
* 2.3 *
+ Intersections involving bounding boxes now include Cartesian.h.
  They are not included by <CGAL/intersections_2.h> anymore.
  Instead, there is a file <CGAL/Bbox_2_intersections.h>
+ The guards around include directives are removed (for modern compilers
  there is no increase in compilation speed, so readability prevails).

-----
* 2.2.2 *
+ cgal_test now reports diff of program output and expected output.

-----
* 2.2.1 *
+ Qualified is_finite calls with ::CGAL::.

-----
* 2.2 *
+ Replaced dir.vector() by dir.to_vector() in several places to avoid a bug in
  egcs 2.91.66 compiler.

-----
* 2.1.8 *
+ Replaced using declarations by explicit qualification in test files.
  So, instead of using std::cout; , use std::cout everywhere.

-----
* 2.1.7 *
+ cgal_test now writes to ProgramOutput* file

-----
* 2.1.6 *
+ Small change to test/cgal_test

-----
* 2.1.5 *
+ Updated all testfiles
  added int as return type for main whre necessary to avoid warnings
  added using declarations for cout, cin and ios.

-----
* 2.1.4 *
+ Added some CGAL_ prefixes to inclusion guards

-----
* 2.1.3 *
+ Adapted cgal_test and makefile in test directory to new install_cgal.

-----
* 2.1.2 *
+ Fixed a bug in template specialisation syntax.
