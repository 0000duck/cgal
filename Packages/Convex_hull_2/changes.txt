3.9    (25 Jun 2001)
- renamed convex_hull_points_2 to convex_hull_2 (keeping convex_hull_points_2
  for backward compatability, but it's undocumented)
- in traits classes switched from use of CGAL::Point_2<R> to K::Point_2, etc.
- introduced traits classes with capitalized names and made the uncapitalized
  ones simply typedefs for the new ones, but couldn't introduce the right file
  names for these since the uncapitalized ones need to be there for backward
  compatability and Windows can't handle fine names that differ in 
  capitalization only.

  in predicate_objects_on_points_2.h

1.3   -> 1.3.1
- warning (unreachable statement) in ch_graham_andrew.C fixed

1.2.3 -> 1.3
- Traits classes now provide member functions that generate instances
  of function objects. The name of these generating member functions
  is according to the following rule: It starts with get_ followed 
  by the name of the function object class (starting with small letter), 
  followed by _object. For example, there are 
  Traits::Leftturn Traits::get_leftturn_object()  and
  Traits::Right_of_line 
  Traits::get_right_of_line_object(const Traits::Point_2&, const Traits::Point_2&). 
  The algorithms now create the function objects they use by these 
  generating functions. The generating member functions allow the function 
  objects to depend on data in a traits class object.

  so far the output for a copy of the input was checked)
- non-recursive version of quickhull
