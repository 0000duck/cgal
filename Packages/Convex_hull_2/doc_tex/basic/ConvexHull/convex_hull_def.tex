A subset $S \subseteq \R^d$ is convex if for any two points $p$ and $q$
in the set the line segment with endpoints $p$ and $q$ is contained
in $S$. The convex hull\ccIndexMainItemDef{convex hull} of a set $S$ 
is the smallest convex set containing
$S$. The convex hull of a set of points $P$ is a convex 
polytope with vertices in $P$. A point in $P$ is an extreme point 
(with respect to $P$)\ccIndexMainItemDef{extreme point} if it is a vertex of 
the convex hull of $P$.
