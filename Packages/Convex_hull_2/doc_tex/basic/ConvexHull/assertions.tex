The assertion flags for the convex hull and extreme point algorithms
use \ccc{CH} in their names (\textit{e.g.}, \ccc{CGAL_CH_NO_POSTCONDITIONS}).  
For the convex hull algorithms, the postcondition
check tests only convexity (if not disabled), but not containment of the
input points in the polygon or polyhedron defined by the output points. 
The latter is considered an expensive checking and can be enabled by
defining \ccc{CGAL_CH_CHECK_EXPENSIVE}%
\ccIndexAssertionFlagName{CGAL_CH_CHECK_EXPENSIVE}.
