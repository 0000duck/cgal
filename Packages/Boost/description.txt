The Boost module contains an import (in the CVS sense) of the Boost library.
Currently only the include files are there.
It also contains some test programs to evaluate the portability of some
Boost libraries.

Here are the commands used to perform the import :
cd boost_1_33_0/boost
cvs import -m "Import of Boost v. 1.33.0" -I ! CGAL/Packages/Boost/include/boost BOOST BOOST_1_33_0
cd ~/tmp
cvs checkout -jBOOST_1_32_0 -jBOOST_1_33_0 Boost
cd Boost
cvs commit
