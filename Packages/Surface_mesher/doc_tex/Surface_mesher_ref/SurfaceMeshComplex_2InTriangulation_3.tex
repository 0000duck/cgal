\ccDefinition
  
The concept \ccRefName\ describes a data structure
designed  to represent a  two dimensional pure complex 
embedded in a three dimensional triangulation.

A {\em complex} is a set $C$ of faces such that~:\\
- any subface of a face in $C$ is a face of $C$ \\
- two faces of $C$ are disjoint or share a common subface \\
The complex is {\em two dimensional}, if its faces have dimension at most
two. It is {\em pure} if any face in the complex is a subface
of some face of maximal dimension.
Thus a two dimensional pure complex is a set of facets
together with their edges and vertices.
A  two dimensional pure complex  embedded 
in a three dimensional triangulation
it is a subset of the  facets 
of this triangulation.



The concept \ccRefName\  is particularly suited to handle
surface meshes obtained as the restriction to a surface of 
a  three dimensional Delaunay triangulation.
A model of this concept is to  be used as first parameter in the global
function \ccc{make_surface_mesh<C2T3,Oracle,Criteria,Tag>}.


The concept \ccRefName\   is a simplification of more general concepts called
 respectively \ccc{PureComplex2InTriangulation3}
\ccc{Complex2InTriangulation3}.
\ccc{PureComplex2InTriangulation3} is  designed to represent  pure complex
and \ccc{Complex2InTriangulation3} is designed to represent any
two dimensional complex. 
Both concepts include member functions to analyse the complex,
i.e. find its size, number of connected components, genus etc...

of \ccc{Triangulation_3})
in such a way that facet \ccc{f} is oriented by the
outward normal of tetraedra \ccc{c}. 
If there is no such neighbor, or if the edge is singular the functions returns \ccc{Facet()}.}
