Planar Parameterization of Triangulated Surface Meshes

This CGAL Package implements some of the state-of-the-art parameterization methods, such as LSCM (Lévy et al. 02), fixed or free boundary conformal maps, Authalic, Floater mean coordinate values or Tutte uniform weights. It proposes an interface with both the 2D Triangulation Data Structure enriched with 3D points and the Polyhedron.
