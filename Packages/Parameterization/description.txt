Planar Parameterization of Triangulated Surface Meshes

Parameterizing a surface amounts to finding a one-to-one mapping from a suitable domain to the surface. In this package, we focus on triangulated surfaces that are homeomorphic to a disk and on piecewise linear mappings into a planar domain.

This CGAL package implements some of the state-of-the-art parameterization methods, such as Least Square Conformal Maps, fixed or free boundary conformal maps, Authalic, Floater Mean value coordinates or Tutte uniform weights.

The package proposes an interface with both the 2D Triangulation Data Structure enriched with 3D points and the Polyhedron.

Since parameterizing meshes require efficient representation of sparse matrices and efficient iterative or direct linear solvers, we provide link to standard packages (TAUCS, SuperLU) and propose a separate package devoted to OpenNL sparse linear solver (Levy).
