\section{Introduction}

Parameterizing a surface amounts to finding a one-to-one mapping from
a suitable domain to the surface. A good mapping is the one which
minimizes either angle distortions (conformal parameterization) or
area distortions (equiareal parameterization) in some sense.

In this package, we focus on triangulated surfaces that are homeomorphic to a
disk and on piecewise linear mappings into a planar domain.

Although
the main motivation behind the first parameterization methods was the
application to texture mapping, it is now frequently used for mapping
more sophisticated modulation signals (such as normal, transparency,
reflection or light modulation maps), fitting scattered data,
re-parameterizing spline surfaces, repairing CAD models, approximating
surfaces and remeshing.

This \cgal\ package implements some of
the state-of-the-art parameterization methods, such as LSCM (Levy et
al. 02), fixed or free boundary conformal maps, Authalic, Floater mean
coordinate values or Tutte uniform weights.

The package proposes
an interface with both the 2D Triangulation Data Structure enriched
with 3D points and the Polyhedron.

Since parameterizing meshes require
efficient representation of sparse matrices and efficient iterative or
direct linear solvers, we provide link to standard packages (TAUCS, SuperLU)
and propose a separate package devoted to OpenNL sparse linear solver (Levy).

The intended audience of this package is researchers, developers or
students developing algorithms around parameterization of triangle
meshes for geometry processing as well as for signal mapping on
triangulated surfaces.
