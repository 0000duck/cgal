\subsection{General thoughts}

\begin{itemize}

\item I like the idea of changing MovingObjectTable to ActiveObjectTable. Not sure if Notifying\_table should follow suit. 

\item Regular triangulation 3 is not entirely working.

\item I reorganized out of existance my 3D demos.

\item The other trajectory modification events need to be documented

\item There is no testing of the Delaunay 3 Visitor class. 

\item The architeture figure goes to the end for some reason. 

\end{itemize}
