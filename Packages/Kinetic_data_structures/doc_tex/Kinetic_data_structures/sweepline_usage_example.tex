\subsection{A Sweepline Algorithm}
\label{sec:sweepline_example}

Here we present a simple example that uses the kinetic data structures
framework to implement a sweepline to compute the arrangement of
x-monotone algebraic curves in the plane. The arrangement and the
curves are then output as a metapost file which can be converted into
a postscript file to view using the mpost command. The code is very
simple and written to be read.
