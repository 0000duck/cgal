Nef_2 Package: Release changes
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1.6 (11 Apr 2002)

     - Removed HalfedgeDS_using_in_place_list.h and HalfedgeDS_default.h
       in include/CGAL/Nef_2. They are not used anymore (there counterparts
       in include/CGAl are used in general except for MSC).

1.5 (24 Mar 2002)

     - added iterator access function documentation
     - converted to use of CGAL_NTS gcd function 

1.4 (22 Mar 2002)

     - Changed conditional compilation for _MSC_VER to 
       _MSC_VER <= 1200 (i.e. VC6). We'll try to get the general
       design to work with VC7.

1.3 (19 Mar 2002)

     - PM_overlayer.h: changed use of Partition to Union_find.

1.2 (19 Mar 2002)

     - added some CGAL_LEDA_SCOPEs to make conversion to LEDA version
       with namespaces
     - added missing CGAL:: in demo program
     - minor changes to please SunPro CC

1.1 (18 Mar 2002)

     - include/CGAL/HalfedgeDS_default_MSC.h: Fixed bug in copy
       constructor and assignment operator to copy pairs instead of 
       single halfedges. Bug reported by Xiangmin Jiao and fixed in 
       original HalfedgeDS 3.4 (15 Jun 2001).
     - include/CGAL/HalfedgeDS_default_MSC.h: Added use of 
       CGAL_ALLOCATOR, otherwise the default allocator used in
       In_place_list that could be incompatible with new/delete
       would have created problems.
