Nef_2 Package: Release changes
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1.1 (18 Mar 2002)

     - include/CGAL/HalfedgeDS_default_MSC.h: Fixed bug in copy
       constructor and assignment operator to copy pairs instead of 
       single halfedges. Bug reported by Xiangmin Jiao and fixed in 
       original HalfedgeDS 3.4 (15 Jun 2001).
     - include/CGAL/HalfedgeDS_default_MSC.h: Added use of 
       CGAL_ALLOCATOR, otherwise the default allocator used in
       In_place_list that could be incompatible with new/delete
       would have created problems.

0.9 (9 Sept 2000)
