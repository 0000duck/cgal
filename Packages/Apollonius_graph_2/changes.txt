  MacOS X Tiger
- reverted MP_Float related change in test_ag_hierarchy_2.C

22 July 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- fixed problems created with wrong insertion of copyright headers in demo

20 July 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- added copyright headers in demo files

30 June 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- added get_conflicts() methods (similar to those in regular and Delaunay
  triangulations); need to update the doc and the testsuite also.

26 June 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- doc: added Triangulation_data_structure type and tds() method; also added
  that the Apollonius_graph_2 class is a model of the DelaunayGraph_2 concept.
- doc: added Vertex and Face types in the Apollonius_graph_2 class; fixed
  some errors in the definition of the various iterators/circulators.
- AG2 class: almost all combinatorial types are now defined through Agds and 
  not the triangulation (except the Finite_*_iterator types).

21 June 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- removed unused code related to homogeneous coordinates/representations
- changed code in traits to minimize function/method calls
- renamed some methods

15 June 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas

  taken are now printed on the label.
- added file menu in demo; used for file I/O.
- added about boxes in demo.

13 June 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- changed messages/captions of the file toolbar of the demo program

4 June 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- Apollonius_graph_2 and Apollonius_graph_hierarchy_2: added methods file_input
  and file_output that read and write from and to a file. The data written
  consists of the visible and hidden sites and the triangulation data
  structure; in the case of the hierarchy, the entire hierarchy is encoded.
- Apollonius_graph_2 and Apollonius_graph_hierarchy_2: added operator>> and
  operator<< that read and write from and to a stream; the methods file_input
  and file_output are used to implement the two operators.
- modified the test suite to test the above mentioned I/O functionality.
- updated documentation to reflect the newly added I/O functionality.

1 June 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- added types Arity and result_type in Construct_Apollonius_vertex_2.
- in Construct_Apollonius_*_2: the constructor object for the Apollonius
  site or vertex is now taken from the geometric traits.
- fixed bug in visualization of primal Apollonius graph when the dual Voronoi
  edge is degenerate (zero length).

29 May 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas

- added tds() method that returns the triangulation data structure

19 May 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- added the types Vertex, Face and Triangulation_data_structure in the
  Apollonius_graph_2 class; these types should also appear in the doc of
  the class

- changed maintainer's email

27 April 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- fixed misprint sent by Anatoly.Zaretksy <anatoly.zaretsky@gmail.com>
  in method: Object_2 dual(const Face_handle& f) of Apollonius_graph_2

7 March 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- replaced calls to the vertex handle methods degree() and
  incident_{edges,faces}() by calls to the corresponding TDS methods that
  take the vertex as argument. This was done in compliance with the latest
  changes in the design of the Triangulation_2 software.
- modified test suite to comply with the above change
- added access method in Apollonius_graph_2 that returns a const reference
  to the TDS.
- added fix for a nasty warning on the PowerPC version of G++ 3.4

4 October 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- removed "\ccInclude{iostream}" from Apollonius_site_2.tex in the reference
  manual; it was causing the manual tools to post a warning

10 September 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- test.h: fixed typo that was creating an error in Microsoft and
  Intel compilers.

7 September 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas

5 June 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- changed name of line argument in Parabola_2 constructor to avoid
  warning of SunPro CC compiler

14 May 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- warning of SunPro CC 5.30 for uninitialized variable in
  Ag2_infinite_edge_test_C2.h

13 May 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- replaced Vertex_handle(NULL) by Vertex_handle()
- replaced comparisons of vertex and face handles against NULL by
  comparisons against {Vertex,Face}_handle()

- fixed bugs in test suite and examples, created by the changes of April 25th

26 April 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- CC-5.30_SunOS-5.8 was complaining about the static constants of the
  Parabola_2 and Hyperbola_ray_2 classes; these constants are now given
  my static methods

25 April 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- changes in the traits: moved the various functors from
  predicates/Apollonius_graph_predicates_C2.h to separate files named
  predicates/Ag2_*.h; the two traits classes have been appropriately modified
- the Apollonius_graph_face_base_2.h file no longer exists; changed the data
  structures so that the requirement is now Triangulation_gace_base_2<Gt>;
  this reduces the memory requirements
- the version before these (major) changes can be recovered using the tag
  before_design_changes_April_2004
- the doc has been appropriately modified to reflect the changes in the
  requirements of the face base class
- the doc for the Apollonius_graph_2 class has been modified to define
  size_type; also the types that are typedefs from the data structure are now
  defined as typedefs instead of nested types

13 April 2004 Menelaos Karavelas 
- split the apollonius graph test suite into three separate parts;
  this will hopefully decrease compilation time and memory requirements
  for the compilation

  Qt_widget.h is not used in these files.

1.60 (5 January 2004) [mk]
