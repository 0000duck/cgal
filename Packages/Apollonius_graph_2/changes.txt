- changes in the traits: moved the various functors from
  predicates/Apollonius_graph_predicates_C2.h to separate files named
  predicates/Ag2_*.h; the two traits classes have been appropriately modified
- the Apollonius_graph_face_base_2.h file no longer exists; changed the data
  structures so that the requirement is now Triangulation_gace_base_2<Gt>;
  this reduces the memory requirements
- the version before these (major) changes can be recovered using the tag
  before_design_changes_April_2004
- the doc has been appropriately modified to reflect the changes in the
  requirements of the face base class
- the doc for the Apollonius_graph_2 class has been modified to define
  size_type; also the types that are typedefs from the data structure are now
  defined as typedefs instead of nested types

13 April 2004 Menelaos Karavelas 
- split the apollonius graph test suite into three separate parts;
  this will hopefully decrease compilation time and memory requirements
  for the compilation

25 March 2004 Radu Ursu
- made doc work with the current manual tools implementation

1.68 (08 February 2004) [rursu]

- fixed bugs that gcc 3.4 was complaining about; mainly added "this->"
  in front of inherited methods

1.66 (25 January 2004) [mk]
- make some undocumented methods protected in Apollonius_graph_2;
  test suite was appropriately altered; these changes have also been
  reflected in the CGAL 3.0 bug fix release

1.65 (21 January 2004) [mk]
- number_of*() methods now return size_type

1.64 (19 January 2004) [mk]
- removed the macro CGAL_CFG_MATCHING_BUG_2

1.63 (16 January 2004) [mk]
- updated the doc for the changes in the previous submission

1.62 (6 January 2004) [mk]
- moved Qt_widget related I/O to a separate file

1.61 (6 January 2004) [mk]
- removed inclusion of Qt_widget.h from Parabola*2.h and Hyperbola_segment_2.h
  Qt_widget.h is not used in these files.

1.60 (5 January 2004) [mk]
- changed the code so that it is compatible with the new filter
  iterator design (no begin iterator needed any longer in the
  filter iterator)

1.59 (6 November 2003) [mk]
- Radu updated the project file for the demo so that it
  reflects the new files involved in the demo

1.58 (30 October 2003) [mk]
- copied (and added to the package) the cgal.bib file from the
  user manual to the reference manual

1.57 (29 October 2003) [rursu]
- fixed files for _MSC_VER but not INTEL
  check for CGAL_T2_USE_ITERATOR_AS_HANDLE 

1.56 (24 October 2003) [af]
- Vertex_handle and Vertex_iterator are equivalent (change in T2)

1.55 (17 October 2003) [af]
- Added another \protect

1.54 (16 October 2003) [mk]
- added files doc_tex/basic/Apollonius_graph_2/htmlfiles

1.53 (16 October 2003) [af]
- Added file doc_tex/basic/Apollonius_graph_2/htmlfiles
- protect'ed \ccc in a \caption

1.52 (14 October 2003) [af]
- Moved \chapter from Apollonius_2.tex to main.tex

1.42 (4 Septemer 2003) [rursu]
- added project to build the demo (apollonius_graph_2.vcproj)
- renamed demo.C in apollonius_graph_2.C
- Demo use now CGAL common demoicon as the main window icon :)
