* check TODO file in include/CGAL
- restore the changes in the examples directory (example3.C and example4.C)
- in the second example in the examples directory, first fall back to
  CORE and then to double.
- check what the method finite_vertex() in the Apollonius_graph_2
  class returns when there are not finite vertices
- add Object_2 as a type in the traits class and use that in
  Apollonius_graph_2
- the is_valid method should print to std::cerr. check if this is the
  case.
- write a Hidden_point_iterator; or change code so that hidden
  vertices have associated vertex_handles
- update doc for vertex base and face base when the new design arrives
- remove from the code the type for Site (in the traits class and the
  main class if it is there)
- change the draw_* methods to write_* in Apollonius_graph_2.{h,C}
- check the typedefs.h file in the demo directory to make sure that
  definitions make sense
