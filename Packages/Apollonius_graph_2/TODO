- restore the changes in the examples directory (example3.C and example4.C)
- "number_of_hidden_weighted_points()" in vertex base should return size_t;
  also add this in the spec. all number_of*() methods should now
  return size_t;
- rewrite the face base class so that the additional edges are provided
  by an adaptor.
- to decrease memory usage remove the two arrays of pairs of Edges and
  integers from the face base class
