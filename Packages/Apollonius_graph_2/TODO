* check TODO file in include/CGAL
- restore the changes in the examples directory (example3.C and example4.C)
- update doc for vertex base and face base when the new design arrives
- "number_of_hidden_weighted_points()" in vertex base should return size_t;
  also add this in the spec.
- rewrite the face base class so that the additional edges are provided
  by an adaptor.
- check if I can replace the Compare_x_2 and Compare_y_2 predicates by
  the Compare_xy_2 predicate.
- in the doc of Vertex_conflict_2 predicate (ApolloniusGraphTraits_2)
  write something about the perturbation scheme.
- in the reference doc for the classes add the types for the template
  parameters.
- rewrite some of the example programs to do deletions and nearest
  neighbor queries.
- write doc, code and example with the filtered traits.
