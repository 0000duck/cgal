- The file Triangulation_dsul_face_2.h has to disappear. This has to be done
  after the appropriate changes are done in the triangulation data structure
  of CGAL.
- The special degenerate cases for some of the predicates need to be done
- The insertion does not work if the new disk leaves less than 2 non-trivial
  disks. I need to fix this.
- When insertion and deletion are done several maps are used to keep track
  of the information. These maps should be replaced by something that is more
  efficient (constant time for all operations instead of logarithmic).
- When deletions are done use the current information to locate the nearest
  neighbor of the trivial disks to be added.
- When there are only 1 or 2 vertices in the triangulation and we add the
  next one the test whether the new one is trivial is not done correctly.
  In particular of the new contains (one of) the existing one(s) we get a
  wrong answer.
- Removal of a degree 4 vertex when I have 4 sites does not work
- Change all the calls to CGAL::Object(..Wrapper.. o) to
  CGAL::make_object(o)
