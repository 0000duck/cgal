- The insertion works if the new disk leaves less than 2 non-trivial
  disks, but then deletion does not work. This should be due to the
  fact that now I have an 1D triangulation instead of 2D.
- The insertion does not work if the new site contains all previous ones.
- When insertion and deletion are done several maps are used to keep track
  of the information. These maps should be replaced by something that is more
  efficient (constant time for all operations instead of logarithmic).
- Check what happens if in the hierarchy I add lots of trivial sites, all 
  inside the same one.
