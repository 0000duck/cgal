\section{Introduction}

This chapter describes quickly what interval arithmetic is, its implementation
in \cgal\ and its possible use by geometric programs.

The main reason for having interval arithmetic in \cgal\ is its integration
into a geometric predicate pre-compiler, but we also provide a number type so
that the users can use it separately if they find any use for it.

The purpose of interval arithmetic is here to provide an efficient way to
control the errors made by floating point computations.

Interval arithmetic is a large concept and we will only consider here a simple
arithmetic based on intervals which bounds are {\it double}s.
So each variable is an interval representing any value inside the interval.
All arithmetic operations made on intervals give a result that contain all
possible values.

\smallskip

For example, if the final result of a sequence of arithmetic operations is an
interval that does not contain zero, then you can surely decide the sign of the
result.

\section{\cgal\ classes}

\subsection {Class CGAL\_Interval\_nt}

\begin{ccClass} {CGAL_Interval_nt}

\ccInclude{CGAL/Interval_arithmetic.h}

\ccTypes

The two following classes provide the same functionality (in fact, the
first one derives from the second one).

\ccTypedef{class CGAL_Interval_nt;} {Represents the interval number type.}

\ccTypedef{class CGAL_Interval_nt_advanced;} {Is faster but requires more work
from the user.}

All functions required by a class to be considered a \cgal\ number type are
present, sometimes with a particular semantic, notably~:

\ccCreationVariable{I}

\ccMethod{CGAL_Interval_nt operator/(CGAL_Interval_nt J);} {is defined with the
following meaning for the degenerate case where the denominator is an interval
containing zero~: it returns the interval ]$-\infty$;$+\infty$[ (the 'division
by zero' exception can be raised, but the default is to ignore it, see next
paragraph for details).}

\ccFunction{CGAL_Interval_nt sqrt(const CGAL_Interval_nt& I);} {is defined and
produces an error if the lower bound of the interval is a negative number.}

\ccMethod{bool operator<(CGAL_Interval_nt J);} {returns {\it true} when any
value in $I$ is inferior to any value in $J$.}

\ccMethod{bool operator==(CGAL_Interval_nt J);} {returns {\it true} when $I$
and $J$ overlap (or intersect).}

\ccMethod{bool operator>(CGAL_Interval_nt J);} {is defined logically from the
previous ones}
\ccMethod{bool operator<=(CGAL_Interval_nt J);} {idem}
\ccMethod{bool operator>=(CGAL_Interval_nt J);} {idem}
\ccMethod{bool operator!=(CGAL_Interval_nt J);} {idem}

\ccFunction{double CGAL\_to\_double(const CGAL_Interval_nt& I);} {returns the
middle of the interval, as a double approximation of the interval.}

\ccMethod{double lower_bound();} {returns the lower bound of the interval.}
\ccMethod{double upper_bound();} {returns the upper bound of the interval.}

\smallskip

\ccCreation

\ccConstructor{CGAL_Interval_nt(const double& d = 0);} {introduces an interval
which bounds are \ccc{d}.}

\ccConstructor{CGAL_Interval_nt(const double& d, const double& e);}
{introduces the interval [d;e].}

Several functions should provide a cast from any numerical type used by \cgal,
to an interval CGAL\_Interval\_nt.

\end{ccClass}

\subsection {Class CGAL\_Interval\_nt\_advanced}

{\it CGAL\_Interval\_nt} derives from {\it CGAL\_Interval\_nt\_advanced},
which allows you to make faster computations, but you need to set the correct
rounding mode of the FPU (towards infinity) before doing any computation with
this number type.  See below for details, and the tests programs.


\section{Implementation details}

The basic idea is to use the directed rounding modes specified by the {\it
IEEE 754} standard, which are implemented by almost all processors nowadays.

It states that you have the possibility, concerning the basic floating point
operations ($+,-,*,/,\sqrt{}$) to specify the rounding mode of each operation
instead of using the default which is usually to round to the nearest.

This feature allows us to compute easily on intervals.  For example, to add
the two intervals [a.i;a.s] and [b.i;b.s], compute $c.i=a.i+b.i$ rounded
towards minus infinite, and $c.s=a.s+b.s$ rounded towards plus infinite, and
the result is the interval [c.i;c.s].  This method can be extended easily to
the other operations.

\smallskip

The problem is that we have to change the rounding mode very often, and the
functions of the C library doing this operation are slow and different from
one architecture to another.  That's why assembly versions are used as often
as possible.

Another trick is to compute the opposite of the lower bound, instead of the
normal lower bound, which allows us to change the rounding mode once less.

Therefore, all basic operations, which are in the class {\it
CGAL\_Interval\_nt\_advanced} assume that the rounding mode is set to positive
infinite, and everything work with this correctly set.  The class {\it
CGAL\_Interval\_nt} takes care of this, but is a bit slower.

\smallskip

Note also that NaNs are not handled, so be careful with that
(especially if you 'divide by zero').


\section{FPU rounding modes}

We provide functions (in C or assembly) to change the rounding mode, these are~:
\begin{itemize}
\item CGAL\_FPU\_set\_rounding\_to\_zero()
\item CGAL\_FPU\_set\_rounding\_to\_nearest()
\item CGAL\_FPU\_set\_rounding\_to\_infinity()
\item CGAL\_FPU\_set\_rounding\_to\_minus\_infinity()
\end{itemize}

\section{Platform support state}

This part of \cgal\ must be ported to each non-supported platform, because of
the use of directed rounding modes.  Here is the current state of the
supported platforms~:

\begin{itemize}
\item Sparc
\begin{itemize}
\item g++ uses the assembly versions, independant of the OS.
\item CC uses the C library functions to change the rounding modes.  Works
      under Solaris (SunOS doesn't use the same files, sorry).
\end{itemize}
\item Intel
\begin{itemize}
\item g++ uses the assembly versions, independant of the OS (Linux tested).
\item I don't know about Windows (NT, 95), nor Solaris or others.
\end{itemize}
\item Alpha
\begin{itemize}
\item g++ 2.7.2 doesn't support (g++ 2.8 and egcs do) the necessary command line
	option (to set the dynamic rounding mode).  There are several
	possibilities to make it work, but all of them are painful.
\item CC: I don't know, but cc works when you specify the command line option
      "-fprm d".
\end{itemize}
\item Mips
\begin{itemize}
\item g++ and CC use the C library functions.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{Example}

I give here a simple example about how to make safe and fast predicates.
This kind of problem is going to be resolved automatically by a predicate
compiler, but before it is available, you can do it by hand.
Let's consider the {\it which\_side} predicate~:

\begin{verbatim}
int which_side(Point<double> P, Point<double> Q, Point<double> R)
{
  double a = P.x-R.x;
  double b = Q.x-R.x;
  double c = P.y-R.y;
  double d = Q.y-R.y;
  double det = a*d-b*c;

  return (det>0) ? 1 : ( (det<0) ? -1 : 0 );
}
\end{verbatim}

This function becomes the following, if you want it to be exact~:

\begin{verbatim}
#include "CGAL/Interval_arithmetic.h"
typedef CGAL_Interval_nt Dis;

int which_side(Point<double> P, Point<double> Q, Point<double> R)
{
  Dis a = (Dis) P.x - (Dis) R.x;
  Dis b = (Dis) Q.x - (Dis) R.x;
  Dis c = (Dis) P.y - (Dis) R.y;
  Dis d = (Dis) Q.y - (Dis) R.y;
  Dis det = a*d-b*c;

  if (det == 0)
  {
    // Note: this doesn't work, but the idea is here.
    return which_side((Point<LEDA_Real>) P, (Point<LEDA_Real>) Q, (Point<LEDA_Real>) R);
  }
  else return (det>0) ? 1 : -1;
}
\end{verbatim}


\section{Files}

The files involved are~:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it CGAL/Interval\_arithmetic.h} contains the definition of the
      two classes.
\item {\it CGAL/\_FPU.h} contains the C and assembly definitions for the
      rounding mode selection.
\end{itemize}

Note that symbols in \_FPU.h are all prefixed by {\it CGAL\_FPU\_}.
