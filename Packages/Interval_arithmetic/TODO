Concerning the code itself:

- Try to fix that warning:
  /usr/ccs/bin/as: "/var/tmp/ccBHnU0T.s", line 861: warning: 3 instructions
  required between ldfsr and next FBfcc; nops inserted
- include "Fixed" support (CGAL_to_interval_nt).
- go on with "typedef CGAL_Interval_nt IA", if the test-suite is ok.
? overwrite overlap_action() so that it differs between IA and IA_advanced.
  This implies declaring it as virtual...  It first needs a bench on
  predicates.
? template by float/double ? (=> must provide CGAL_FPU... for floats...)
? implement operator{<,>,<=,>=}(double) -> the current operators will be
  implemented using them, and the tests (IA) > 0 will be faster ?
  Also, this would simplify the *() and /() code.
  But be careful with exceptions... => 2 different semantics.
? shall I protect ostream operator<<() by CGAL_FPU... ?
  it seems there's a pb with Linux here.  Hum... it's not MY fault.

Concerning the script:

- It also has to fix the headers, the "#define"s, and add #include <IA>.
  I've done it by hand for the moment.

Concerning the doc:

- re-read the doc carefully.
- document the change of behaviour in the comparison operators, and the effect
  of CGAL_IA_DONT_THROW_EXCEPTION...
- describe the filtering scheme (new class CGAL_Filter -> new paragraph).
? document the speed up with (double * IA).
? document is_same().

Concerning the test-suite:

- small benchs on a few predicates.
- test cast functions (are they dependant on rounding modes).
- test NaNs (and Infs?).  Comparisons with these should throw the exception.
