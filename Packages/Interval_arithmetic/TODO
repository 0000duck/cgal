Concerning the code itself:

- add operators like (double * Interval) -> Interval.
  (double * double) -> Interval, is not overloadable, and doesn't gain much.
- shall I protect ostream operator<<() by CGAL_FPU... ?
- template by float/double ? (=> must provide CGAL_FPU... for floats...)

Concerning the test-suite:

- test cast functions.
- benchs.
