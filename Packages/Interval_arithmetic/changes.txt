Changes done to the Interval Arithmetic package.

Version 4.16 on 24 June 1999
- Added specializations for the regular triangulation predicates.
- The script now adds "CGAL::", so that it works for the predicates
  outside namespace CGAL.
- IO operators are now in libCGAL, not inlined anymore.
- Preliminary not-working-yet Linux/PowerPC support contributed
  by Pierre Angelier.
- Removed the old FPU_set_rounding_to_{zero|nearest|...} functions.

- Removed a useless assertion(false) in the predicates.
- ship workaround_4_irix as assembly file instead of object.

Version 4.11 on 4 May 1999
- Introduced macro CGAL_IA_FORCE_TO_DOUBLE to workaround an Intel processors
  "feature", breaking the intervals that underflow or overflow.
- The test-suite should not say "n" when LEDA is not there.

- Fixed typo breaking MipsPro.

Version 4.0 on 22 April 1999
- Fixed typo preventing use of assembly versions...

Version 3.8 on 20 April 1999
- Fixed small bugs.
- Updated documentation.

Version 3.7 on 15 April 1999
- Partial workaround for lack of partial specialization of the predicates.
- New template parameter "Filter_Cache" to Filtered_exact<CT,ET> to allow
  caching of the conversion to intervals (default is off).

Version 3.6 on 15 April 1999
- Final (hopefully) workaround for the rounding modes on IRIX.
- Workaround for lack of convert_to<target>(source), replaced by
  convert_from_to(target(), source).

Version 3.5 on 1 April 1999

Version 3.3 on 19 March 1999
- Forgot the src/ directory in the package :(

Version 3.2 on 19 March 1999

Version 3.1 on 12 March 1999
- New functions FPU_get_cw() and FPU_set_cw() replace the old ones.
- Major cleanup of _FPU.h.
- Updated documentation.
- Added a counter of failures "Interval_nt_advanced::number_of_failures".

Version 3.0 on 11 March 1999
- Namespace CGAL.
- Introduced .exact() and .interval() member functions to the filtered type.
- Removed SunPro comments in the doc.
- Support standard headers.
- More operators (intervals with doubles) supported.
- Union and intersection on intervals (operators || and &&).
- Quotient<RT> supported by the filtering stuff.
- function "convert_to<>()" replaced by "struct converter::do_it()".

Version 2.7 on 22 December 1998

- Added CGAL_square(), and benchmark for it.
- Added lots of checks enabled with CGAL_IA_DEBUG.
- Updated rtH2 predicates.
- Fixed CGAL_convert_to<>() functions with respect to rounding mode, and
  template<>.
- Assembly for Mips disabled.
- Added CGAL_FPU_get_rounding_mode() and CGAL_FPU_set_rounding_mode().  Not
  documented for the moment.  And test program tst0.C for that.

Version 2.6 on 10 December 1998
- Big renaming that does:
  - /Filter/            -> /Arithmetic_filter/
  - Filter.h            -> Arithmetic_filter.h
  - CGAL_FILTER_H       -> CGAL_ARITHMETIC_FILTER_H
  - CGAL_Filtering      -> CGAL_Filtered_exact
  - CGAL_to_exact_type  -> CGAL_convert_to
  - CGAL_to_IA[advanced]-> CGAL_convert_to<IA[advanced]> ()
- SunPro and MipsPro are definitely not supported anymore.
- Support for ftC3 and rtH2 (partially) is included.
- Massive doc update.
- The whole thing is supposed to be really "frozen for 1.2" now.
- Mips assembly enabled back, hopefully Geert-Jan has upgraded to 1.1.1,
  and the problem will be fixed.

Version 2.5 on 26 November 1998
- Mips assembly commented out, it fails for the test-suite...
- Filtering stuff in place, doc updated.

Version 2.4 on 12 November 1998
- Mips + GNU uses assembly versions (thanks to Christoph Burnikel).
- CGAL_{sign,compare,abs,min,max,is_valid,is_finite} specialized for speed and
  correctness.
- <CGAL/Filter.h>: new file containing the wrapper for filtered predicates.
- include/CGAL/Filter/predicates_on_ft_C2.h: new file containing the
  specializations for the filtering scheme.

Version 2.3 on 23 October 1998
- the test-suite now includes some benchmark.
- the code is optimized, even uses the GNU extension "named return value".

Version 2.2 on 16 October 1998
- removed more spurious constructors.
- removed bugs in _FPU.h
- much improved test suite, 100% coverage (except casts).

- Moved private files to the directory CGAL/Interval_arithmetic
- Doc update: cgal.bib removed, geombib is updated.
- Using CVS.
- [sent Stefan the necessary updates to other NTs].

Version 1.6 on 10 May 1998.

- Added a CGAL_warning_msg() when you compare 2 overlapping intervals,
  disabled by the compilation flag CGAL_IA_NO_WARNINGS (or CGAL_NO_WARNINGS).

- Doc updates:
  - better introduction.
  - fixed bugs shown by the HTML version.
  - update the support status for the Alpha.
