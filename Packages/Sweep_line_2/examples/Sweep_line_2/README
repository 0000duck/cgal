In this directory there are 5 example program for the Sweep Line package.

example1: Demonstate the use of the sweep line algorithm in order to
          construct a planar map of line segments.
 
example2: Demonstate the use of the sweep line algorithm in order to
          construct a planar map of polylines.
     
example3: Demonstate the use of the sweep line algorithm in order to
          produce a collection of disjoint interior sub-segments.
 
example4: Demonstate the use of the sweep line algorithm in order to
          produce a collection of disjoint interior polyline sub-segments.

example5: Demonstate the use of the sweep line algorithm in order to
          produce a collection of all intersection points of the
          given segments in the input.
