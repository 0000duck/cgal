\section{Implementation}

The sweep line algorithm was implemented according to Bentley and
Ottmann~\cite{bkos-cgaa-97}. The implementation is robust. It supports general
curves and handles all degenerate cases, including overlapping curves,
vertical segments, and tangency between curves.

The STL $map$-container is used for the implementation of the event queue, and
the STL $set$-container is used for the implementation of the status line.
Additional containers are used to accomodate all intersection points for each
input curve ordered from left to right, and all the resulting subcurves for
each event point. 

The complexity of this algorithm is $O(n\log{n} + k\log{n})$ where $n$ is the 
number of the input curves and $k$ is the number of intersection points 
induced by these curves.
