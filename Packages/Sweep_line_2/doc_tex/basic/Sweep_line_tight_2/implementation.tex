\section{Implementation}

The sweep line algorithm was implemented according 
Bentley and Ottmann~\cite{bkos-cgaa-97}. It supports general 
curves and all 
possible degenerate cases including overlapping curves, vertical segments, 
and tangency between curves.

In the implementation we use the STL container $map$ to hold the event queue 
as well as the status line. 

The complexity of this algorithm is $O(n\log{n} + k\log{n})$ where $n$ is the 
number of the curves specified int he input and $k$ is the number of 
intersection points induced by these curves.
