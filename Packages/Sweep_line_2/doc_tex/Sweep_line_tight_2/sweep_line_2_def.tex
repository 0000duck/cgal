\section{Introduction}

% Put here a description of what's in this chapter

In this chapter we describe the functionality provided by
\cgal\ to produce disjoint-interior subcurves and intersection points 
of a given collection 
$C:=\{c_1, \ldots c_n\}$ of planar curves.

We take advantage of the sweep line algorithm implemented here to provide
an efficient construction of a Planar Map with Intersection. See 
\ccc{CGAL::Pm_with_intersection} for more deatils.

% Put here the definition of the algorithm (theory)
Let $C:=\{c_1, \ldots c_n\}$ be the set of curves for which we want 
to compute all intersections. We want to avoid testing pairs of segments 
that are far apart. To find the intersecting pairs we imagine sweeping  
a line $l$ from left to right over the plane, starting from a position 
left to all curves. While we sweep the imaginary line, we keep track of all 
curves intersecting it.

This type of algorithm is called a {\em plane sweep algorithm} and the line 
$l$ is called the {\em sweep line}. The {\em status} of the sweep line is 
the set of curves intersecting it. The status of the status line changes at 
specific points, called {\em event points},  
as the sweep line progresses to the right. These specific points are
the endpoints of the curves and their intersection points. The initial set of 
{\em event points} consists of the endpoints alone. Additional 
{\em event points} are added as intersection points are calculated.
