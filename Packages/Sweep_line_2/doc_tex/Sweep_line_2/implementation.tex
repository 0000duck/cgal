\section{Implementation}

The sweep line algorithm was implemented is according 
Bentley and Ottmann~\cite{bkos-cgaa-97}. It supports general 
curves and all 
possible degenerate cases including overlapping curves, vertical segments, 
and tangency between curves.

The implementation uses the container $map$ defined in STL for
the implementation of the event queue and the status line. The implementation
also keeps an associated container of all 
intersection points for each input curve ordered from left to right, 
and all the outcoming curves for each event point. 

The complexity of this algorithm is $O(n\log{n} + k\log{n})$ where $n$ is the 
number of the input curves and $k$ is the number of intersection points 
induced by these curves.
