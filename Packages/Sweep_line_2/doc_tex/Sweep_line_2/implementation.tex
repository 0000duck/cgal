\section{Implementation}

The implementation of the sweep line algorithm is according 
Bentley and Ottmann \cite{bkos-cgaa-97}, and rather supports general curves and all 
possible degenerate cases including the overlapping case. 
The algorithm is static, means it needs to know all curves in the input 
in advance. 

The implementation uses the container $map$ defined in STL for
implementing the event queue and the status line. The implementation
also keeps an associated container of all 
intersection points per each input curve ordered from left to right, 
and also keeps all the outcoming curves for each event point. 
The complexity of this algorithm is $O(n\log{n} + k\log{n})$ where $n$ is the 
number of the input curves and $k$ is the number of intersection points induced by these
curves.
