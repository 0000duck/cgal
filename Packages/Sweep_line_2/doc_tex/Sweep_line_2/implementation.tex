\section{Implementation}

The implementation uses the container $map$ defined in STL for
implementing the event queue and the status line. The implementation
also keeps per each input curve an associated container of all its
intersection points ordered from left to right, and also keeps per
each event point all its outcoming curves. The complexity of this
algorithm is $O(n\log{n} + k\log{n})$ where $n$ is the number of the input
curves and $k$ is the number of intersection points induced by these
curves.
