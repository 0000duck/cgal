Subject: CGAL 3.0.1 Released
Body:

This is a bug-fix release.
No new features have been added in 3.0.1.  Here is the list of bug-fixes.

Installation :
- ???

Planar_map :
- Fixed the so called "Walk-along-a-line" point-location strategy to correctly
  handle a degenerate case.

Triangulation_2 :
- added missing figure in html doc
- in  Line_face_circulator_2.h :
   Fixed changes made to support handles with a typedef to iterator.
   The fix concerns operator== and !=.

Alpha_shapes_3 :
- fixed classify member function for edges

Number types :
- Lazy_exact_nt :
  - added the possibility to select the relative precision of to_double()
    (by default 1e-5).  This should fix reports that some circumcenters
    computations have poor coordinates, e.g. nan).
  - when exact computation is triggered, the interval is recomputed, this
    should speed up some kinds of computations.
- to_interval(Quotient<MP_Float>) : avoid spurious overflows.

Kernel :
- missing acknowledgment in the manual and minor clarification of intersect()
  documentation.
