Subject: CGAL 3.1 Released, Computational Geometry Algorithms Library
Body: 

We are pleased to announce the release 3.1 of CGAL, the Computational Geometry
Algorithms Library.  


Besides improvements of existing packages this release offers
the following new algorithms and data structures.

 o 2D Segment Voronoi Diagram

   A data structure for Voronoi diagrams of segments in the plane under
   the Euclidean metric. The Voronoi edges are arcs of straight lines and
   parabolas. The algorithm provided in this package is incremental.


 o 2D Conforming Triangulations and Meshes

   An implementation of Shewchuk's algorithm to construct conforming
   triangulations and 2D meshes.


 o 3D Boolean Operations on Nef Polyhedra

   A new class (Nef_polyhedron_3) representing 3D Nef polyhedra, a
   boundary representation for cell-complexes bounded by halfspaces that
   supports boolean operations and topological operations in full
   generality including unbounded cells, mixed dimensional cells (e.g.,
   isolated vertices and antennas). Nef polyhedra distinguish between
   open and closed sets and can represent non-manifold geometry.


 o Planar Nef polyhedra embedded on the sphere

   A new class (Nef_polyhedron_S2) designed and supported mainly to
   represent sphere neighborhoods around vertices of the three-
   dimensional Nef polyhedra.


 o dD Box_intersection_d

   A new efficient algorithm for finding all intersecting pairs for large
   numbers of iso-oriented boxes, i.e., typically these will be bounding
   boxes of more complicated geometries. Useful for (self-) intersection
   tests of surfaces etc.


 o 2D Snap Rounding

   Snap Rounding is a well known method for converting
   arbitrary-precision arrangements of segments into a fixed-precision
   representation. In the study of robust geometric computing, it can be
   classified as a finite precision approximation technique. Iterated
   Snap Rounding is a modification of Snap Rounding in which each vertex
   is at least half-the-width-of-a-pixel away from any non-incident
   edge. This package supports both methods.


 o 2D and Surface Function Interpolation

   This package implements different methods for scattered data
   interpolation: Given measures of a function on a set of discrete data
   points, the task is to interpolate this function on an arbitrary query
   point. The package further offers functions for natural neighbor
   interpolation.

The CGAL project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust,
easy-to-use, and efficient C++ software library of geometric data 
structures and algorithms. The CGAL library contains:
o Basic geometric primitives such as points, vectors, lines, predicates
  for testing things such as relative positions of points, and operations
  such as intersections and distance calculation.
o A collection of standard data structures and geometric algorithms, 
  such as convex hull, (Delaunay, Regular, Constrained) triangulation, Voronoi
  diagrams, planar map, arrangements, polyhedron, smallest enclosing sphere,
  multidimensional query structures...
o Interfaces to other packages, e.g. for visualization, and I/O, and 
  other support facilities. 



The basic geometric primitives are distributed under the terms of the LGPL 
Open Source license (GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1).  
The data structures and algorithms are distributed under the terms of the QPL 
Open Source license (Q Public License v1.0).
So CGAL remains free of use for you, if your usage meets the criteria of
these licenses, otherwise, a commercial license must be purchased from
Geometry Factory (www.geometryfactory.com).
