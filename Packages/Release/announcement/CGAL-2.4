Subject: CGAL 2.4, Computational Geometry Algorithms Library
Body: 
We are pleased to announce release 2.4 of CGAL, the Computational 
Geometry Algorithms Library.

Major additions in this release include:

o Support for Visual C++ 7.0, SunPro 5.3, and g++ 3.1

o A sweep-line algorithm to compute arrangements of curves
o Quicker insertion functions for planar maps
o 2D constrained triangulations with intersecting constraints
o running time improvements for 3D triangulations
o Polyhedral surface design introduced with release 2.3 is now supported on
  Visual C++ 7.0
o A new class for visualization of 2D CGAL objects based on Trolltech's
  Qt class QWidget.

See http://www.cgal.org/releases_frame.html for a complete list of
changes.

The CGAL project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust,
easy-to-use, and efficient C++ software library of geometric data 
structures and algorithms. The CGAL library contains:
o Basic geometric primitives such as points, vectors, lines, predicates
  for testing things such as relative positions of points, and operations
  such as intersections and distance calculation.
o A collection of standard data structures and geometric algorithms, 
  such as convex hull, (Delaunay) triangulation, planar map, polyhedron, 
  smallest enclosing sphere, and multidimensional query structures.
o Interfaces to other packages, e.g. for visualization, and I/O, and 
  other support facilities.
