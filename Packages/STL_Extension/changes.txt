GLOB: Fix Compact_container for VC 7.1.
GLOB: - Sun doesn't have operator!= for std::reverse_iterator
GLOB: removed stlport/cgal_functional_base.h
GLOB: Fix typo in iterator.h
GLOB: SRC : Excluded vector from MSC VC6.
GLOB: SRC : Added != and comparison ops for test class X in test_vector.C.
GLOB: SRC : Changed vector to improve cross platform compilation.

ALL : SRC : Added vector class in include/CGAL/vector.h.
ALL : TEST: Added vector test program in test/STL_Extension/test_vector.C

ALL : Added compose_shared.
ALL : Fixed Arity_traits problem.
ALL : Fixed Inverse_index for buggy gcc-3 map acc. to Eti.
ALL : Changed Iterator_project as Lutz suggested.
ALL : Added merge and sort parameterized with a StrictWeakOrdering to in-place
ALL :  list.

//---------------------------------------------------------------------
//	 CGAL 2.1
//---------------------------------------------------------------------

DOCS: now joind into stl_extension.tex.
TEST: Removed conditional include checks.
SRC : Removed superfluous template parameter D in operator+(D,*).
SRC : Introduced CGAL_LIMITED_ITERATOR_TRAITS_SUPPORT for MSVC.
SRC : Don't use iterator_category(...), if iterator traits are there.
ALL : Added file algorithm.h.
ALL : New functions min_max_element and min/max_element_if.
SRC : Added N_step_adaptor_derived.
SRC : Fixed _Circulator_size_traits to I_Circulator_size_traits.
SRC : Removed obsolete workaround flags.
ALL : Removed line directives.
