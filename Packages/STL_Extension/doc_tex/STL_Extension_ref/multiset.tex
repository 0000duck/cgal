\label{class:cgal_multimap}
\ccCreationVariable{s}

\ccDefinition
%============

An instance \ccVar\ of the parametrized data type \ccRefName\ is a
multi-set of elements of type \ccc{Type}, represented as a red-black tree
(see~\cite[Chapter~13]{clrs-ia-01} for an excellent introduction to red-black
trees).
The main difference between \ccRefName\ and \stl's \ccc{multiset} is that
the latter uses a less-than functor with a Boolean return type, while our
\ccRefName\ class is parameterized by a comparison functor \ccc{Compare} that
returns the three-valued \ccc{Comparison_result} (namely it returns either
\ccc{SMALLER}, \ccc{EQUAL}, or \ccc{LARGER}). It is thus possible to maintain
the underlying red-black tree with less invocations of the comparison functor.
This leads to a speedup of about 5\% even if we maintain a set of integers.
When each comparison of two elements of type \ccc{Type} is an expensive
operation (for example, when they are geometric entities represented using
exact arithmetic), the usage of a three-valued comparison functor can lead to
considerable decrease in the running times.

Moreover, \ccRefName\ allows the insertion of an element into the set given
its {\em exact} position, and not just using an insertion hint, as done by 
\ccc{std::multiset}. This can further reduce the running times, as additional
comparison operations can be avoided.

In addition, the \ccRefName\ guarantees that the order of elements sent to the
comparison functor is fixed. For example, if we insert a new element \ccc{x}
into the set (or erase an element from the set), then we always invoke 
\ccc{Compare() (x, y)} (and never \ccc{Compare() (y, x)}), where \ccc{y} is an
element already stored in the set. This behavior, not supported by
\ccc{std::multiset}, is sometimes crucial for designing more efficient
comparison predicates.

\ccRefName\ also allows for look-up of keys whose type may differ from
\ccc{Type}, as long as users supply a comparison functor \ccc{CompareKey},
where \ccc{CompareKey() (key, y)} returns the three-valued
\ccc{Comparison_result} (\ccc{key} is the look-up key and \ccc{y} is an
element of type \ccc{Type}). Indeed, it is very convenient to look-up
equivalent objects in the set given just by their key. We note however that
it is also possible to use a key of type \ccc{Type} and to employ the default
\ccc{Compare} functor for the look-up, as done when using the
\ccc{std::multiset} class.

\begin{ccAdvanced}

Finally, \ccRefName\ introduces the \ccc{catenate()} and \ccc{split()}
functions. The first function operates on \ccVar\ and accepts a second
set \ccVar', such that the maximum element in \ccVar\ is not greater than
the minimal element in \ccVar', and concatenates \ccVar' to \ccVar. The
second function splits \ccVar\ into two sets,one containing all the
elements that are less than a given key, and the other contains all
elements greater than (or equal to) this key.

\end{ccAdvanced}

\ccParameters
%------------

The \ccc{Multiset} class-template has three parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item \ccc{Type} --- the type of the stored elements.
\item \ccc{Compare} --- the comparison-functor type. This type should provide
    the following opeator for comparing two \ccc{Type} elements, namely: \\
  \ccc{Comparison_result operator() (const Type& t1, const Type& t2) const;}\\
    The \ccc{CGAL::Compare<Type>} functor is used by default. In this case,
    \ccc{Type} must support an equality operator (\ccc{operator==}) and a
    less-than operator (\ccc{operator<}).
\item \ccc{Allocator} --- the allocator type. \\
    \ccc{CGAL_ALLOCATOR} is used by default.
\end{itemize}

%-----------------------------

\ccMethod{void replace (iterator position, const Type& x);}{
    replaces the element stored at the given position with \ccc{x}.
    \ccPrecond\ The operation does not violate the set order --- that is,

\ccMethod{void swap (iterator pos1, iterator pos2);}{
    swaps places between the two elements given by \ccc{pos1} and  \ccc{pos2}.

                \ccc{pos1} and \ccc{pos2} store equivalent elements.}

\def\ccLongParamLayout{\ccTrue}
\ccMethod{void catenate (Self& s_prime);}{
    concatenates all elements in \ccc{s_prime} into \ccVar\ and clears
    \ccc{s_prime}.
    All iterators to \ccVar\ and to \ccc{s_prime} remain valid.
    \ccPrecond\ The maximal element in \ccVar\ is not greater than the minimal
                element in \ccc{s_prime}.}

    splits \ccVar\, such that it contains all elements that are less than
    the given \ccc{key} and such that \ccc{s_prime} contains all other elements.

\ccMethod{void split (iterator position, Self& s_prime);}{
    splits \ccVar\, such that it contains all set elements in the range
    \ccc{[begin, position)} and such that \ccc{s_prime} contains all elements
    in the range \ccc{[position, end())}.
    \ccPrecond\ \ccc{s_prime} is initially empty.}
\def\ccLongParamLayout{\ccTrue}

\end{ccAdvanced}

\ccImplementation
%================

\ccc{Multiset} uses a proprietary implementation of a red-black tree
data-structure. The red-black tree invariants guarantee that the height of a 
tree containing $n$ elements is $O(\log{n})$ (more precisely, it is bounded by 
$2 \log_{2}{n}$). As a consequence, all methods that accept an element and need
to locate it in the tree (namely \ccc{insert(x)}, \ccc{erase(x)}, 
\ccc{find(x)}, \ccc{count(x)}, \ccc{lower_bound(x)} , \ccc{upper_bound(x)},
 \ccc{find_lower(x)} and  \ccc{equal_range(x)}) take $O(\log{n})$ time and
perform $O(\log{n})$ comparison operations.

On the other hand, the set operations that accept a position iterator (namely
\ccc{insert_before(pos, x)}, \ccc{insert_after(pos, x)} and \ccc{erase(pos)})
are much more efficient as they can be performed at a {\em constant} amortized 
cost (see~\cite{gs-dfbt-78} and~\cite{t-dsna-83} for more details).
More important, these set operations require {\em no} comparison operations.
Therefore, it is highly recommended to maintain the set via iterators
to the stored elements, whenever possible. The function \ccc{insert(pos, x)} 
is safer to use, but it takes amortized $O(\min\{d,\log{n}\})$ time, where $d$
is the distance between the given position and the true position of \ccc{x}. 
In addition, it always performs at least two comparison operations.

\begin{ccAdvanced}

The \ccc{catenate()} and \ccc{split()} functions are also very efficient, and
can be performed in $O(\log{n})$ time, where $n$ is the total number of
elements in the sets, and without performing any comparison operations
(see~\cite{t-dsna-83} for the details).
Note however that the size of two sets resulting from a split operation is
initially unknown, as it is impossible to compute it in less than linear time.
Thus, the first invocation of \ccc{size()} on such a set takes linear time,
and {\em not} constant time.

\end{ccAdvanced}

The design is derived from the \stl\ \ccc{multiset} class-template (see,
e.g,~\cite{cgal:ms-strg-96}), where the main differences between the two
classes are highlighted in the class definition above.
