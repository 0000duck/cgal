STL_Extension Package
---------------------------------------------------------------------

-  CGAL/In_place_list.h

     A doubly linked list managing items in place. Used in polyhedron.

-  CGAL/function_objects.h

     Projection function objects like identity, projection, typecast, 
     access to point, plane, normal of vertex or facet respectively.
     Creator function objects. Classes for composing function objects

-  CGAL/copy_n.h

     A function copying n items from an input iterator. It is the same
     function as in the SGI STL, though since it is not in the C++ Standard
     we provide our own.

-  CGAL/Join_input_iterator.h

     Joins multiple iterators to constuct a new iterator.

-  CGAL/Iterator_identity.h
-  CGAL/Circulator_identity.h
-  CGAL/Iterator_project.h
-  CGAL/Circulator_project.h

     Iterator and circulator adaptor. Identity mapping or parameterized
     with a function object that performs a projection (like data accessors.)

-  CGAL/Circulator_on_node.h

     An adaptor which implements a circulator for a linked data structure.
     It is parameterized with function objects that accesses the next
     and previous information for the nodes.

-  CGAL/Counting_iterator.h

     An iterator adaptor that implements ranges based on an internal count.
     Useful do derive ranges from input iterators.

-  CGAL/N_step_adaptor.h

     An iterator and circulator adaptor that makes bigger jumps (N)
     for each single step.

-  CGAL/Inverse_index.h

     Inverse_Index adaptor enumerates sequences.

-  CGAL/Random_access_adaptor.h
-  CGAL/Random_access_value_adaptor.h

     Random Access Adaptor provides random access for sequences.


Note that these classes and their documentation started to be ment
for internal use. Note therefore that the documentation might lack
completeness and details.

Michael Hoffmann (ETH) takes over the maintenance of this package 
with release 2.7 (28 Jul 1999).
