\begin{ccRefConcept} {AlphaShapeTraits_2}

\ccCreationVariable{t}

\ccDefinition
The concept \ccRefName\ that satisfies the requirements of a
\ccc{AlphaShapeTraits_2} class must provide the following predicate and
operations in addition to the requirements for the underlying triangulation
traits class.

\ccTypes

\ccNestedType{Coord_type}{A type to hold a coordinate type class. 
The type must provide a copy constructor, assignment, comparison
operators, negation, multiplication, division and allow the
declaration and initialization with a small integer constant
(cf. requirements for number types). 
\ccPrecond An obvious choice would be coordinate type of the point class.}

\ccCreation

Only a default constructor is required. Note that further constructors
can be provided. 

\ccConstructor{Gt();}
{A default constructor.}

\ccHeading{Constructions by function objects}

\ccMethod{Compute_squared_radius_2 compute_squared_radius_2_object();} 
{Returns an object, which has to be able to compute the squared radius of the
circle of the points \ccc{p0, p1, p2} or the squared radius of smallest  circle
of the points \ccc{p0, p1}, as \ccc{Coord_type} associated with the metric used
by \ccc{Dt}.} 

\ccHeading{Predicate by function object}

\ccMethod{Side_of_bounded_circle_2 side_of_bounded_circle_2_object();}
{Returns an object, which has to be able to compute the relative position of
point \ccc{test} to the smallest circle of the points \ccc{p0, p1}, using the
same metric as \ccc{Dt}.}
