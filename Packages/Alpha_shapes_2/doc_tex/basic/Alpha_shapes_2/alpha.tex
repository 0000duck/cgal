\chapter{Alpha-Shapes} \label{I1_ChapterAlphashapes}

\ccChapterSubTitle{\alphashapeRevision, \alphashapeDate}

\section{Introduction}

This chapter presents a framework for alpha shapes. The description is based on
the articles \cite{em-tdas-94,e-was-92}. Alpha shapes are
the generalization of the convex hull of a point set. Let $S$ be a finite set of
points in $\R^d$, $d = 2,3$ and $\alpha$ a parameter with $0 \leq \alpha \leq
\infty$. For $\alpha = \infty$, the $\alpha$-shape is the convex hull of $S$. As 
$\alpha$ decreases, the $\alpha$-shape shrinks and develops cavities, as soon as 
a sphere of radius $\sqrt{\alpha}$ can be put inside.
Finally, for $\alpha = 0$, the $\alpha$-shape is the set $S$ itself.

We distinguish two versions of alpha shapes, one is based on the Delaunay
triangulation and the other on its generalization, the regular triangulation,
replacing the natural distance by the power to weighted points. The metric used
determines an underlying triangulation of the alpha shape and thus, the version
computed. 
In one hand, there is the {\em classic alpha shapes}
(cf. \ref{I1_SectClassicAS}) associated with the Delaunay triangulations
(cf. \ref{I1_Sect_Delaunay}), in the other hand, the {\em weighted alpha shapes}
(cf. \ref{I1_SectWeightedAS}) associated with the regular triangulations
(cf. \ref{I1_Sect_Regular}). 

There is a close connection between alpha shapes and the underlying
triangulations. More precisely, the $\alpha$-complex of $S$ is a
subcomplex of this triangulation of $S$, containing the $\alpha$-exposed
$k$-simplices, $0 \leq k \leq d$. A simplex is $\alpha$-exposed, if there is an
open disk (resp.\ ball) of radius $\sqrt{\alpha}$ through the vertices of the
simplex that does not contain any other point of $S$, for the metric used in
the computation of the underlying triangulation.  The corresponding
$\alpha$-shape is defined as the underlying interior space of the
$\alpha$-complex. 

In general, an $\alpha$-complex is a non-connected and non-pure polytope, it
means, that one $k$-simplice, $0 \leq k \leq d-1$ is not necessary adjacent to
a $(k+1)$-simplice.

The $\alpha$-shapes of $S$ form a discrete family, even though they
are defined for all real numbers $\alpha$ with $0 \leq \alpha
\leq \infty$. Thus, we can represent the entire family of $\alpha$-shapes
of $S$ by the underlying triangulation of $S$. In this representation
each $k$-simplex of the underlying triangulation is associated with an
interval that specifies for which values of $\alpha$ the $k$-simplex
belongs to the $\alpha$-shape. Relying on this result, the family of
$\alpha$-shapes can be computed efficiently and relatively
easily. Furthermore, we can select an appropriate $\alpha$-shape from a
finite number of different $\alpha$-shapes and corresponding
$\alpha$-values.

\subsection*{Main Application}

Alpha shapes can be used for shape reconstruction from a dense unorganized set
of data points. The  $\alpha$-shape is demarcated by a frontier, which is, under
conditions described for the classic version in \cite{bb-srmua-97t}, a linear
approximation of the original contour.

\section{Generic Alpha-Shapes of Points in a Plane \label{I1_SectAlpha_Shape_2}}

\begin{ccClassTemplate} {Alpha_shape_2<Dt>}

\ccDefinition

The class \ccClassTemplateName\ represents the family of
$\alpha$-shapes of points in a plane for {\em all} positive
$\alpha$. It maintains the underlying triangulation \ccc{Dt} which
represents connectivity and order among its faces. Each
$k$-dimensional face of the \ccc{Dt} is associated with
an interval that specifies for which values of $\alpha$ the face
belongs to the $\alpha$-shape. There are links between the intervals
and the $k$-dimensional faces of the triangulation.

\ccInclude{CGAL/Alpha_shape_2.h}

{Classifies the vertex \ccc{v} of the underlying triangulation with respect to \ccVar.}


\ccHeading{Traversal of the $\alpha$-Values}

\smallskip
The alpha shape class defines an iterator that allows to visit the
sorted sequence of $\alpha$-values. This iterator is
non-mutable and bidirectional. Its value type is
\ccc{Coord_type}.

\ccMethod{Alpha_iterator alpha_begin() const;}
{Returns an iterator that allows to traverse the
sorted sequence of $\alpha$-values of the family of alpha shapes.}

\ccMethod{Alpha_iterator alpha_end() const;}
{Returns the corresponding past-the-end iterator.}

\ccMethod{Alpha_iterator alpha_find(const Coord_type& alpha) const;}
{Returns an iterator pointing to an element with $\alpha$-value
\ccc{alpha}, or the corresponding past-the-end iterator if such 
an element is not found.}

\ccMethod{Alpha_iterator alpha_lower_bound(const Coord_type& alpha) const;}
{Returns an iterator pointing to the first element with
$\alpha$-value not less than \ccc{alpha}.}

\ccMethod{Alpha_iterator alpha_upper_bound(const Coord_type& alpha) const;}
{Returns an iterator pointing to the first element with $\alpha$-value
greater than \ccc{alpha}.}

\ccHeading{Operations}

\ccMethod{int number_solid_components(const Coord_type& alpha = get_alpha()) const;}
{Returns the number of solid components of \ccVar, that is, the number of
components of its 
regularized version.}

\ccMethod{Alpha_iterator find_optimal_alpha(int nb_components) const;}
{Returns an iterator pointing to the first element with $\alpha$-value
such that \ccVar\ satisfies the following two properties:\\
\ccc{nb_components} equals the number of solid components and \\
all data points are either on the boundary or in the interior of the regularized version of \ccVar.\\
If no such value is found, the iterator points to the first element with 
$\alpha$-value such that \ccVar\ satisfies the second property.}

\ccHeading{I/O}

The I/O operators are defined for \ccc{iostream}, and for
the window stream provided by \cgal. The format for the iostream
is an internal format. 

\ccInclude{CGAL/IO/io.h}

\ccFunction{ostream& operator<<(ostream& os,
                  const Alpha_shape_2<Dt>& A);}
{Inserts the alpha shape \ccVar\ for the current $\alpha$-value into the stream \ccc{os}.
\ccPrecond The insert operator must be defined for \ccc{Point}.}

\ccInclude{CGAL/IO/Window_stream.h}

\ccInclude{CGAL/IO/alpha_shapes_2_window_stream.h}

\ccFunction{Window_stream& operator<<(Window_stream& W,
                         const Alpha_shape_2<Dt>& A);}
{Inserts the alpha shape \ccVar\ for the current $\alpha$-value into the window stream \ccc{W}.
\ccPrecond The insert operator must be defined for \ccc{Point} and \ccc{Segment}.}
\end{ccClassTemplate}

\ccImplementation
In the first static version, the set of intervals associated with the
$k$-dimensional faces of the underlying triangulation are
stored only as sorted \ccc{vectors}. By using an interval tree the
alpha-shape could be constructed more efficiently. For the dynamic
version, we need \ccc{multimaps} or dynamic interval trees.

The cross links between the intervals and the $k$-dimensional faces of the
triangulation are actually realized using methods in the $k$-dimensional faces
themselves. By this way, you can decide if you want to store or re-compute any
of these informations.


\ccc{A.alpha find} uses linear search, while 
\ccc{A.alpha lower bound} and \ccc{A.alpha upper bound} 
use binary search.
\ccc{A.number solid components} performs a graph traversal and takes time
linear in the number of faces of the underlying triangulation.
\ccc{A.find optimal alpha} uses binary search and takes time
$O(\mbox{ \em n } \log{\mbox{ \em n } })$, where  $n$ is the number of points.

\section{The Underlying Triangulation\label{I1_SectDtClass}}

For the \ccc{Dt} class, you have to choose between a Delaunay or a regular
triangulation, depending the version of alpha shapes, you want.

The class \ccc{Dt} must be parameterized with a special alpha shape
traits class and a simple triangulation data structure, with no more requirements as
for a simple triangulation class, but parameterized by a special vertex base
class and a special face base class.

\section*{The Alpha-Shape Traits Class (\mbox{\it Gt})\label{I1_ASTraits}} 

\subsection{Requirements for the Alpha-Shape Traits Class}

First, this traits class has the same requirements as the 
triangulation traits class, for the \ccc{Dt} triangulation, you opted.
The following requirement catalog lists the primitives that must be defined
additionally.


\begin{ccClass} {Gt}
\subsection*{\protect \ccc{Alpha_shape_traits} (\mbox{\it Gt})}

\ccCreationVariable{t}

\ccDefinition
A class \ccClassName\ that satisfies the requirements of a
\ccc{Alpha_shape_traits} class must provide the following predicate and
operations in addition to the requirements for the underlying triangulation
traits class.

\ccTypes

\ccNestedType{Coord_type}{A type to hold a coordinate type class. 
The type must provide a copy constructor, assignment, comparison
operators, negation, multiplication, division and allow the
declaration and initialization with a small integer constant
(cf. requirements for number types). 
\ccPrecond An obvious choice would be coordinate type of the point class.}

\ccCreation

Only a default constructor is required. Note that further constructors
can be provided. 

\ccConstructor{Gt();}
{A default constructor.}

\ccHeading{Constructions}

\ccMethod{Coord_type squared_radius(const Point& p0,
				const Point& p1, 
				const Point& p2) const;} 
{Returns the squared radius of the circle of the
points \ccc{p0, p1, p2}, associated with the metric

{Returns the relative position of point \ccc{test} to the smallest circle of
the points \ccc{p0, p1}, using the same metric as \ccc{Dt}.}

\end{ccClass}


\section*{Triangulation Data Structure Class (\mbox{\it Tds}) for an Alpha-Shape}

The class \ccc{Alpha_shape_2<Dt>} parameterized with a
triangulation data structure class \ccc{Tds}, that has exactly the same
requirements as the triangulation data structure class for a simple
triangulation.  

But, she requires to be templated by special \ccc{Alpha_shape_vertex_base} and
\ccc{Alpha_shape_face_base<Df>}, to store the alpha values associated. Thus, we need to
define the requirements of such Alpha Shape \ccc{Alpha_shape_vertex_base} and
\ccc{Alpha_shape_face_base<Df>} classes.

\subsection{Requirements for the \protect \ccc{Vertex_base} Class of an
Alpha-Shape\label{I1_SectVertex}} 

The information about the alpha values associated  are accessible by the 
vertices of the alpha shape. Thus the nested \ccc{Alpha_shape_vertex_base}
type of an alpha shape offers additional functionalities to deal with these
methods. 

This additional functionalities related to the Alpha Shape
are requirements which have to be fulfilled
by the base vertex for an Alpha Shape,
in addition to the functionalities required for a simple triangulation vertex.
They are listed below as such.

\subsection{Requirements for the \protect \ccc{Face_base} Class of an Alpha-Shape}

type of an alpha shape offers additional functionalities to deal with these
methods.

\ccc{Df} has to be choosed as the face base for the underlying triangulation.

for the Alpha Shape. The class
\ccc{Alpha_shape_vertex_base_2<Gt>} simply derived from 
\ccc{Triangulation_vertex_base_2<Gt>}.

\ccInclude{CGAL/Alpha_shape_vertex_base_2.h}

\subsection*{Predefined \protect \ccc{Face_base} Class}

\cgal\ provides a default \ccc{Face_base} class
for the Alpha Shape. The class
\ccc{Alpha_shape_face_base_2<Gt,Df>} simply derived from 
\ccc{Df}, which can be instantiated with \ccc{Regular_triangulation_face_base_2<Gt>}.

\subsection*{To Do a Weighted Alpha-Shape}

\ccExample
The following code details the different steps to create 
a weighted version of alpha shape with the defaults.

\begin{cprog}
typedef CGAL::Cartesian<double> Rp;
typedef CGAL::Weighted_alpha_shape_euclidean_traits_2<Rp> Gt;
typedef CGAL::Alpha_shape_vertex_base_2<Gt> Vb;
typedef CGAL::Regular_triangulation_face_base_2<Gt> Rf;
typedef CGAL::Alpha_shape_face_base_2<Gt,Rf>  Fb;
typedef CGAL::Triangulation_default_data_structure_2<Gt,Vb,Fb> Tds;
typedef CGAL::Regular_triangulation_2<Gt,Tds> Rt;
typedef CGAL::Alpha_shape_2<Rt> Alpha_shape_2;
\end{cprog}
