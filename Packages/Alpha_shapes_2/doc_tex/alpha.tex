\section{Introduction}

This chapter presents a framework for alpha shapes. The description is
based on Edelsbrunner and M\"ucke.  Alpha shapes can be used for shape
reconstruction from a dense unorganized set of data points.  Alpha
shapes are the generalization of the convex hull of a point set. Let
$S$ be a finite set of points in $\R^d$, $d = 2,3$ and $\alpha$ a
parameter with $0 \leq \alpha \leq \infty$. For $\alpha =
\infty$, the $\alpha$-shape is the convex hull of $S$.  As $\alpha$
decreases, the $\alpha$-shape shrinks and develops cavities. Finally,
for $\alpha = 0$, the $\alpha$-shape is the set $S$ itself.

There is a close connection between alpha shapes and Delaunay
triangulations. More precisely, the $\alpha$-complex of $S$ is a
subcomplex of the Delaunay triangulation of $S$.  The corresponding
$\alpha$-shape is its underlying space.  Alternatively, the
$\alpha$-shape of $S$ is a polygon (resp.\ polytope) whose boundary
consists of $\alpha$-exposed $k$-simplices, $0 \leq k \leq d-1$. A
simplex is $\alpha$-exposed, if there is an open disk (resp.\ ball) of
radius $\sqrt{\alpha}$ through the vertices of the simplex that does
not contain any other point of $S$. In general, an alpha shape is a
non-connected, mixed-dimension polygon (rep.\ polytope).

The $\alpha$-shapes of $S$ form a discrete family, even though they
are defined for all real numbers $\alpha$ with $0 \leq \alpha
\leq \infty$. Thus, we can represent the entire family of $\alpha$ shapes
of $S$ by the Delaunay triangulation of $S$. In this representation
each $k$-simplex of the Delaunay triangulation is associated with an
interval that specifies for which values of $\alpha$ the $k$-simplex
belongs to the $\alpha$-shape. Relying on this result, the family of
$\alpha$-shapes can be computed efficiently and relatively
easily. Furthermore, we can select an appropriate $\alpha$-shape from a
finite number of different $\alpha$-shapes and corresponding
$\alpha$-values.

\section{Alpha Shape of Points in a Plane \label{I1_SectAlpha Shape_2}}

\begin{ccClassTemplate} {Alpha_shape_2<Gt,Tds>}

\ccDefinition
The class \ccClassTemplateName\ represents the family of
$\alpha$-shapes of points in a plane for {\em all} positive
$\alpha$. It maintains the underlying Delaunay triangulation which
represents connectivity and order among its faces. Each
$k$-dimensional face of the Delaunay triangulation is associated with
an interval that specifies for which values of $\alpha$ the face
belongs to the $\alpha$-shape. There are links between the intervals
and the $k$-dimensional faces of the Delaunay triangulation.

{Classifies the vertex \ccStyle{v} of the underlying Delaunay triangulation with respect to \ccVar.}


\ccHeading{Traversal of the $\alpha$-Values}

\smallskip
The alpha shape class defines an iterator that allows to visit the
sorted sequence of $\alpha$-values. This iterator is
non-mutable and bidirectional. Its value type is
\ccStyle{Coord_type}.

\ccMethod{Alpha_iterator alpha_begin() const;}
{Returns an iterator that allows to traverse the
sorted sequence of $\alpha$-values of the family of alpha shapes.}

\ccMethod{Alpha_iterator alpha_end() const;}
{Returns the corresponding past-the-end iterator.}

\ccMethod{Alpha_iterator alpha_find(const Coord_type& alpha) const;}
{Returns an iterator pointing to an element with $\alpha$-value
\ccStyle{alpha}, or the corresponding past-the-end iterator if such 
an element is not found.}

\ccMethod{Alpha_iterator alpha_lower_bound(const Coord_type& alpha) const;}
{Returns an iterator pointing to the first element with
$\alpha$-value not less than \ccStyle{alpha}.}

\ccMethod{Alpha_iterator alpha_upper_bound(const Coord_type& alpha) const;}
{Returns an iterator pointing to the first element with $\alpha$-value
greater than \ccStyle{alpha}.}

\ccHeading{Operations}

\ccMethod{int number_solid_components(const Coord_type& alpha = get_alpha()) const;}
{Returns the number of solid components of \ccVar, that is, the number of components of its regularized version.}

\ccMethod{Alpha_iterator find_optimal_alpha(int nb_components) const;}
{Returns an iterator pointing to the first element with $\alpha$-value
such that \ccVar\ satisfies the following two properties:\\
\ccStyle{nb_components} equals the number of solid components and \\
all data points are either on the boundary or in the interior of the regularized version of \ccVar.\\
If no such value is found, the iterator points to the first element with 
$\alpha$-value such that \ccVar\ satisfies the second property.}
\ccHeading{I/O}

The I/O operators are defined for \ccStyle{iostream}, and for
the window stream provided by \cgal. The format for the iostream
is an internal format. 

\ccInclude{CGAL/IO/ostream_2.h}

\ccFunction{ostream& operator<<(ostream& os,
                  const Alpha_shape_2<Gt,Tds>& A);}
{Inserts the alpha shape \ccVar\ for the current $\alpha$-value into the stream \ccStyle{os}.
\ccPrecond The insert operator must be defined for \ccStyle{Point}.}

\ccInclude{CGAL/IO/Window_stream.h}

\ccFunction{Window_stream& operator<<(Window_stream& W,
                         const Alpha_shape_2<Gt,Tds>& T);}
{Inserts the alpha shape \ccVar\ for the current $\alpha$-value into the window stream \ccStyle{W}.
\ccPrecond The insert operator must be defined for \ccStyle{Point} and \ccStyle{Segment}.}
\end{ccClassTemplate}

\ccImplementation
In the first static version, the set of intervals associated with the
$k$-dimensional faces of the underlying Delaunay triangulation are
stored only as sorted \ccStyle{vectors}. By using an interval tree the
alpha-shape could be constructed more efficiently. For the dynamic
version, we need \ccStyle{multimaps} or dynamic interval trees. The
cross links between the intervals and the $k$-dimensional faces of the
Delaunay triangulation are actually realized using
\ccStyle{multimaps} resp.\ \ccStyle{hash multimaps}.

\ccStyle{A.alpha find} uses linear search, while 
\ccStyle{A.alpha lower bound} and \ccStyle{A.alpha upper bound} 
use binary search.
\ccStyle{A.number solid components} performs a graph traversal and takes time linear in the number of faces of the underlying Delaunay triangulation.
\ccStyle{A.find optimal alpha} uses binary search and takes time
$O(\mbox{\em number of faces } \log{\mbox{\em number of faces}})$.

\section{Requirements\label{I1_SectRequirements}}


\subsection{Requirements for the Alpha-Shape Traits Class} 

The class \ccStyle{Alpha_shape_2<Gt,Tds>} parameterized with a
traits class, that has the same requirements as the Delaunay
triangulation traits class.  The following requirement catalog lists
the primitives that must be defined additionnally.

\begin{ccClass} {Gt}
\subsection*{Traits (\mbox{\it Gt})}

\ccCreationVariable{t}

\ccDefinition
A class \ccClassName\ that satisfies the requirements of a alpha shape
traits class must provide the following predicate and operations in
addition to the requirements for the Delaunay triangulation traits
class.

\ccTypes

\ccNestedType{Coord_type}{A type to hold a coordinate type class. 
The type must provide a copy constructor, assignment, comparison
operators, negation, multiplication, division and allow the
declaration and initialization with a small integer constant
(cf. requirements for number types). An obvious choice would be
coordinate type of the point class.}

\ccCreation

Only a default constructor is required. Note that further constructors
can be provided. 

\ccConstructor{Gt();}
{A default constructor.}


\ccOperations

\ccMethod{Coord_type squared_radius_smallest_circumcircle(const Point& p0,
                                       		const Point& p1, 
						const Point& p2 );} 
{Returns the squared radius of smallest circumscribing circle of the
points \ccStyle{p0, p1, p2}. }

\ccMethod{Coord_type squared_radius_smallest_circumcircle(const Point& p0,
                                       const Point& p1);} 
{Returns the squared radius of smallest circumscribing circle of the
points \ccStyle{p0, p1}. }

\ccMethod{Bounded_side side_of_bounded_circle(const Point& p0,
                                    const Point& p1,
                                    const Point& test);}
{Returns the relative position of point \ccStyle{test} to the circle
defined as the smallest circumscribing circle of the points \ccStyle{p0,
p1}.}

\end{ccClass}

\subsection{Requirements for the Triangulation Data Structure Class}

The class \ccStyle{Alpha_shape_2<Gt,Tds>} parameterized with a
triangulation data structure class, that has exactly the same
requirements as the Delaunay triangulation triangulation data
structure class. But, she requires to be templated by the the two
paramaters \ccc{Alpha_shape_vertex_base_2} and
\ccc{Alpha_shape_face_base_2}.

\ccInclude{CGAL/Alpha_shape_vertex_base_2.h}

\ccInclude{CGAL/Alpha_shape_face_base_2.h}

These two classes have the same requirements as the classes
\ccc{Triangulation_vertex_base_2} and \ccc{Triangulation_face_base_2}.
