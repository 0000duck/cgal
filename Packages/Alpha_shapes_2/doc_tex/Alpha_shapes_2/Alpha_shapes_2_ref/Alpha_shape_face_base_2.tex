\begin{ccRefClass}{Alpha_shape_face_base<Df>}

\ccDefinition

\ccc{Df} has to be choosed as the face base for the underlying triangulation. 

In addition to the functionalities required by an underlying triangulation face \ccc{Df}.
They are listed below as such.

\ccInheritsFrom

\ccc{Df}

\ccCreationVariable{f}
\ccTypes

\ccNestedType{Interval_3}{A container type to get (and put) the three special values 
($\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3$) associated with an alpha shape edge.}

\ccNestedType{Coord_type}{A type to hold a coordinate type class. 
The type must provide a copy constructor, assignment, comparison
operators, negation, multiplication, division and allow the
declaration and initialization with a small integer constant
(cf. requirements for number types). An obvious choice would be
coordinate type of the point class.
\ccPrecond Let's us precise that \ccc{Coord_type} has to be the same as the one used by
\ccc{Gt}, already used by the underlying triangulation \ccc{Dt}, and by
her face base \ccc{Df}.}

\ccMethod{Interval_3[3] get_ranges();}
{returns a vector \ccc{V}, in which, for each edge $i$, \ccc{V[i]} contains
three alpha values
 $\alpha_1 \leq \alpha_2 \leq \alpha_3$, such as for
$\alpha$  between $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$, the edge indexed with $i$ is
attached but singular, 
for $\alpha$ between $\alpha_2$ and $\alpha_3$, the edge is regular, and for $\alpha$
upper $\alpha_3$, the edge is interior.}

{return the alpha value, under which the alpha shape contains the
face.}
