Manual_tools/TO_DO
==================

-- Bug in linking Assert_circulator in Circulator package in the intro.tex page

-- detect and layout long template parameter lists

-- Documentation

-- Test suite

-- Check what to do with
   Installation/doc_tex/installation
   Tutorial/doc_tex

-- Macro to analyse length value (1pt, 2in, ...) and store in \lciLength
   Implement \hspace and \vspace

-- Allow several chapters in one file, all chapters except the first
   have output filenames with a chapter number per file as suffix

-- OS License GPL for Manual tools: ask ETH/MPI for allowance

-- Merge all three manuals into one to get active cross-links

-- Make User manual to print separately

-- Each Chapter in its own PS file
   try \includeonly and check of TOC gets reduced also

-- Clearer TOC such that user and reference manual are easily identified

-- Add new commands such as
   \ccSummaryMethod{bool is_valid();}{short summary comment}
   That creates a summary entry and a "more" link to the full
   documentation (on the same page, or also applicable to base classes).

-- remove cc_check and cc_extract from distribution, which implies
    - removing them from the src directory
    - removing cc_extract.tex cc_extract.ps.gz from doc directory
    - changing cc_manual.tex to remove references to this (in particular
      the picture that shows how the tools interact)
    - ???

-- some problem with stepcounter

-- ccRefIdfierPage should add the global scope if it's not there.
   This is easier done when access to all .tex files is available as adding
   the scope can be the default action?

-- no linking except inside \ccc command ???

-- no linking of file to itself ???

-- add a command to turn off the link created by \input in HTML

-- make doc convertable to HTML

-- make a list of examples (generated from ccIncludeExample command)
    -- better if all code is included using this command

-- make ccIncludeExample change to a smaller font?

-- syntax highlighting for the HTML examples

-- add a box around the examples and/or use a different background color ???


printed cgal manual
-------------------
-- Check header/footer of printed manuals

-- Change page numbers of printed manual to <Part-Num>-<Chapter-Num> 
   + page per chapter

-- get rif of the underfull \hbox messages for the eps_tabs images
   (annoys finding the real problems in the log.

latex_to_html
-------------
-- Document new filename macros: \lciInputPath, \lciOutputFilename, 
   ...Rootname, ...FilePath, ...Uppath

-- Embedd latex2gif scripts into converter, apply it to figures (check
   if a *.gif or *.png is provided before converting automatically)
   and for complicated formulas etc.

-- Control uses of current filename and main filename to clean those names up

-- Revise the file output handling: merge handleChapter and handleClassFile,
   make it generic and apply it to all sectioning commands depending on
   some level counter. Consider anchor_stream to put on stack as well
   or open and close it for each push and pop.

-- Make also one HTML page possible for a hole LaTeX document.
   For this, embedd TOC, index and library, in main file.

-- Maybe, an *.aux file (named *.hax for latex_to_html), would be good
   to transport TOC entries and other stuff in two-pass translations.

-- If we get a *.hax file, we can also realize \includeonly, where all
   counter values stay preserved.

-- Improve \ifthenelse package with parsing of \and ...

-- Make titlepage convert automatically, see \begin{titlepage}

-- Check if more stuff in the auxfile should be used, 
   should also the aux files of \include'd files be considered

-- Make index only if \makeindex is defined. Adapt header and footers.

-- Make TOC only if \tableofcontents is defined.

-- Make bibliography at its appropriate place.

-- Enter TOC, Index, Biblio into TOC and Navigation only if they exist.

-- Check for completely empty navigation line (for single HTML page
   conversions)

-- Convert my own LaTeX papers as test cases for single HTML page.

-- Check what happens if the main latex input file is in a subdir.

-- More generic #X expand mechanism for \edef, check what \protect does
   (i.e., where to stop the expansions)

-- What does cc_remove_unwanted_links?

-- Move "Next" navigation creation to style file for parametrization.

-- Consider "Prev" navigation lines.

-- hyperlink rules for \ccInclude to link example programs

-- Go through LaTeX book appendix once more to check new macros not 
   yet supported

-- Add counter to theorem environment

-- expandafter macro

-- Enable part title when full hierarchical file output is supported

-- Revise developers manual, also how cgal.bib is _not_ considered

-- Control where 'MultipleParts' macro was used

-- Define protecting comments that are respected by the cc_anchor's and
   can be added around regions that should not have links.

-- Check and improve that cross linking to reference pages point to 
   the top of the page (navigation header), not the section title
   (if the reference pages are in there own file of course).

-- Remove the explicit \ccRefPageBegin/End's from my manual pages
   since they are automatically called in the refPage environment

-- check \v macro for Matousek bib file entry
