-- remove cc_check and cc_extract from distribution, which implies
    - removing them from the src directory
    - removing cc_extract.tex cc_extract.ps.gz from doc directory
    - changing cc_manual.tex to remove references to this (in particular
      the picture that shows how the tools interact)
    - ???

-- some problem with stepcounter

-- ccRefIdfierPage should add the global scope if it's not there.
   This is easier done when access to all .tex files is available as adding
   the scope can be the default action?

-- no linking except inside \ccc command ???

-- no linking of file to itself ???

-- add a command to turn off the link created by \input in HTML

-- figure out a way to cross-reference between manuals

-- make doc convertable to HTML

-- make the indexing commands have an effect in the HTML version.
       Possible approach:
          when HTML converter encounters an index macro it,
           - creates an achor that is <filename>#text_tag
           - writes to a  file .html.idx
          sort .html.idx file by text after the #
          convert .ind file generated by makeindex by comparing text values

-- make a list of examples (generated from ccIncludeExample command)
    -- better if all code is included using this command

-- make ccIncludeExample change to a smaller font?

-- syntax highlighting for the HTML examples

-- add a box around the examples and/or use a different background color ???
