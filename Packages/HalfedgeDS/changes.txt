3.35 (22 Sep 2003)
- new headers

3.34 (10 Apr 2003)

     - Fixed broken HalfedgeDS_vector.

3.32 (26 Apr 2002)

     - Moved externally defined member functions into class body in
       HalfedgeDS_default, HalfedgeDS_list, and HalfedgeDS_vector. 

3.31 (19 Apr 2002)

     - Added missing std:: before ptrdiff_t in HalfedgeDS_list.h.

3.30 (15 Apr 2002)

     - Changed get_iter functions to get_[vhf]_iter functions in 
       HalfedgeDS_vector to solve ambiguity on MSVC7.

     - Resubmitted because of failure in Utrecht.

3.26 (03 Apr 2002)

     - Fixed bug in HalfedgeDS_list.h and HalfedgeDS_vector.h on
       machines needing the CGAL_CFG_NO_TMPL_IN_TMPL_PARAM workaround:
       the _types base class does not need that workaround.

3.25 (28 Mar 2002)

     - More changes in HalfedgeDS_vector to use CGALi::vector class.

     - Split typedef and static section of HalfedgeDS_list and 
       HalfedgeDS_vector into a base class and a derived class
       to help VC7 untangle the dependencies. (The Support_... tags
       proved difficult.) The vector version won't work until we
       get our own vector.

     - Added #include <cstddef> whereever std::size_t is used.

       CGAL::Unique_hash_map improving speed.
     - Proof read and formatted the documentation. 
     - Changes static allocators to local member variables.

     - Static method halfedge_handle() in HalfedgeDS_vector changed.
     - Fixed missing halfedge_handle() call in hds_prog_compact.C to
       make it work with g++ 3.0.

3.10 (25 Jun 2001)

     - Fixed missing Plane dummy types in face_base classes.
     - Remove the HalfedgeDS_using_list
     - Rename HalfedgeDS_using_in_place_list to HalfedgeDS_list
     - Rename HalfedgeDS_using_vector to HalfedgeDS_vector.
     - Fixed 'emplate' typo that shows with MSVC only.

3.9 (21 Jun 2001)

     - Attempt to fix bug in hds_prog_compact.C. 
     - New naming scheme for concepts.
     - New kernel traits introduced.
     - Changed name of HalfedgeDS_items.h to HalfedgeDS_items_2.h.
     - Revised example files and doc.

3.8 (19 Jun 2001)

     - Fixed compilation bugs with Base_base types in halfedge bases.

3.6 (17 Jun 2001)

     - changed erase_all() to clear() for HalfedgeDS concept.

3.5 (15 Jun 2001)

     - hanged filename to avoid upper/lower-case conflict of 
       HalfedgeDS_[Ii]tems.tex.

3.4 (15 Jun 2001)

     - Added missing reference pages in 
       doc_tex/basic/HalfedgeDS/HalfedgeDS_ref/.
     - Added missing *.gif files for the reference pages.
     - HalfedgeDS_using_in_place_list.h: Fixed bug in copy  
       constructor and assignment operator to copy pairs instead of 
       single halfedges. Bug reported by Xiangmin Jiao.
     - Made assignment of empty vertex or face handles while copying
       explicit. Was relying previously on proper default initialization.
     - Fixed warnings in the test suite about unused variables.

3.3 (27 Sep 2000)

     - Fixed warning for ill-formed main() declaration. 
     - Fixed problems with Base_base:: in halfedge_base classes that
       were reported with g++ -pedantic. 
     - Fixed problems with point() and normal() access in the workaround
       for missing partial specializations of the vertex_base and 
       face_base classes.
     - Changed the handling of iterators in HalfedgeDS_using_list.
       The HalfedgeDS_iterator_adaptor relies now on a local static 
       variable to create a unique std::list::iterator. The previous
       solution was using an initializer with 0, which isn't standard
       compliant, and it failed now with the std::list::iterator and KCC.
       The new solution uses zero-initialization of static variables,
       Section 3.6.2, 6.7, and 8.5 of the C++ Standard.

3.2 (21 Sep 2000)

     Converted to std:: and CGAL:: namespaces and using new std 
     header file name convention. The manual pages are separated into 
     user manual pages and reference manual pages, but still in one 
     chapter. Tested with g++ and MipsPro 7.3.

3.1 (26 Mar 1999)

     Complete redesign. Incompatible to previous versions. The design
     provides much more flexibility and can support planar maps and
     other data structures more easily. The class interface has been
     changed to be more in line with STL container classes and the 
     few dependencies on the geometry (point type) are removed.
