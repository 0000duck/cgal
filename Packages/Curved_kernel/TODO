(highest priority is to be able to run at least *something* with 
the new Arrangement_2...)

construct intersection for *arcs* should use solve or solve in range
interface of operator() of construct intersection for circles is
wrong, it should compute circular arc endpoints

add "using..." in all functors that derive from another

implement construct_intersections for general (non monotone) arcs, it
has a meaning.
