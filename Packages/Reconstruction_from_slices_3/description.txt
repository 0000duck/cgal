Package Reconstruction_from_slices :

Provides the following subpackages :

1) Triangulation of points located in planar slices.

The restriction of this triangulation to each slice is 2D Delaunay, and its restriction between two consecutive slices is 3D Delaunay.

2) Reconstruction from slices :
Construction of a volume respecting a set of polylines located on planar slices.
