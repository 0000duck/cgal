This chapter describes \cgal's interpolation package which implements
natural neighbor coordinate functions as well as different
methods for scattered data interpolation most of which are based on
natural neighbor coordinates. The functions for computing natural neighbor 
coordinates in Euclidian space are described in 
Section~\ref{sec:coordinates}, 
the functions concerning the coordinate and neighbor 
computation on surfaces are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:surface}. 
In Section~\ref{sec:interpolation}, we briefly describe the different interpolation functions.   

Scattered data interpolation solves the following problem: given
measures of a function on a set of discrete data points, the task is
to interpolate this function on an arbitrary query point.
More formally, let $\mathcal{P}=\{\mathbf{p_1},\ldots ,\mathbf{p_n}\}$ be a set of
$n$ point in $\mathbb{R}^2$ or $\mathbb{R}^3$ and $\Phi$ be a scalar
function defined inside the convex hull of $\mathcal{P}$. We assume that
the function values are known at the points of $\mathcal{P}$, i.e. to
each $\mathbf{p_i} \in \mathcal{P}$, we associate $z_i =
\Phi(\mathbf{p_i})$. Sometimes, the gradient of $\Phi$ is also known
at $\mathbf{p_i}$. It is denoted $\mathbf{g_i}= \nabla
\Phi(\mathbf{p_i})$. The interpolation is carried out for a point
$\mathbf{x}$ in the convex hull of $\mathcal{P}$.
