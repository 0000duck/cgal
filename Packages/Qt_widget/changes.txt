	Alpha_shape demo contains now a HowTo button in Help menu.

1.3.3 - 06-01-2003
	Fixed Nef2 demo. Both layers could be seen.

1.3.2 - 04-12-2002
------------------
	Fix for Qt-2.3

1.3.1 - 26-12-2002
------------------
	Qt_widget_standard_tollbar now derives from QToolBar.
	Qt_widget_standard_tollbar constructor has two extra optional
arguments, to set the dock area (top, bottom, left, right), if a
newline should be inserted, and the name of the toolbar as a QObject.

1.3.0 - 12-11-2002
------------------
	New icons were introduced in the old icon files.
	Their name is: filename_small_xpm.
	The demos use both of them with QIconSet.

1.2.49 -08-11-2002
-------------------
	The qmainwindow.h header file was missing from some demo files. This fix it's only for Windows cause Linux didn't complain.

1.2.48 - 25-10-2002
-------------------
	Removed precision problem in output operator for segments. The intersection between iso_rectangle and the segment is done in simple_cartesian<double>
	Nef_2 complained about that.

1.2.47 - 22-10-2002
-------------------
	The alpha_shape, triangulation, triangulation_constrained resize the widget to fit the bounding box of loaded triangulation

1.2.46
--------
	The Qt_widget_standard_toolbar contains a layer to display mouse real world coordinates.
	The demos no longer use this layer in their toolbar_layer.

1.2.45
-------
	patched Triangulation_2_constrained for Windows
	clear_history() calls now configure_history_buttons()
	
1.2.44
-------
	patched couple files that were not tested under Linux for the previous modifs 1.2.43

1.2.43
--------
	set_window was setting ranges and added to history even when the geometry of the widget wasn't yet known. Now, set_scaled and add_to_history is delayed in showEvent(...)	 
	the << operators for segment, triangle and triangulation were changed.
	the first 2 of them due to very slow bug when segments were degenerated (very big)
	the << operator for triangulation use the apply_to_range function to output only the visible triangles
	removed redraw from the zoom and the history actions in Qt_widget_standard_toolbar.C. Everything was drawn twice.

	

1.2.42
---------
	set_window was setting ranges even when the geometry of the widget
wasn't yet known. Now, set_scaled is delayed in showEvent(...)


1.2.41
---------
	In Qt_widget x_real_rational and y_real_rational were removed. There is only x_real and y_real, specialized for Gmpq. They have no return type now and the result is passed through the second param.
1.2.40
----------
	Qt_widget have 2 new functions x_real_rational and y_real_rational.
	Those 2 return an Gmpq object. The conversion between screen coordinates and real world coordinates return a more simple number (rational), a Gmpq object.
	I put that in the doc either.

1.2.39
----------
	The VC7 vcproj files were added in binary mode for all the demos in Qt_widget. This projects are configured for RELEASE/DEBUG mode with Qt3.0
	Also couple demos have a cgal_types.h file that contain all the CGAL types definitions.

1.2.38
----------
	The alpha shapes demo was modified.
	The nef_2 output operator for Qt_widget was patched.
	The nef_2 has been added in the testsuite.
