Obviously, these demos need Qt to be installed.

To compile this under linux/unix. Set QTDIR to your Qt install directory 
in Makefile or in your environnement. Then type 
  make
It will create two programs: test and contrained

test is a silly single test program. At first, it draws two segments 
before the window is shown (and it does that to show that drawing can be 
done before the window is shown). After a click, it draws several CGAL 
geometrical object (see essai.C). Try to resize it to see what happens. 
Quit by clicking with the right button.

contrained is an adaptation of a demo from Mariette Yvinnec courses, using 
Qt and QCGALWidget. It has been especially complicated to show how easy 
that is to build an application with a CGAL Widget, a menu and a toolbar. 
Enter points with the left button. You can close the window by clicking 
with the right button or by selecting Quit in the file menu. The option 
Open is to open another contrained triangulation file (fish is the 
default file ).
Again, try to resize the window to see what happened. The difference with 
essai is that init(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) has been called to defined 
fixed ranges and that an redraw method has been defined (to redraw after a 
resize event).
