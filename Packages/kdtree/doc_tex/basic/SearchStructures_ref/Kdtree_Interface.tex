\begin{ccRefClass}{Kdtree_Interface<Point>}

{\cgal}  contains a default implementation for the Kdtree\_d traits
class, that
may be applied to any
standard class of point provided by \cgal.

The default traits class \ccStyle{Kdtree_Interface<Point>} is
templated with a parameter \ccStyle{Point}, which is required to
supply the following methods:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Constructor, and copy constructor.

    \item \ccStyle{int dimension();} - return the dimension of the point.
    
    \item \ccStyle{operator[](int dim);} - an operator for accessing
    the various coordinates of the given point. Used also to copy
    coordinates between points.
\end{itemize}

There are two other default traits classes \ccStyle{Kdtree_Interface_2d<Point>} 
and \ccStyle{Kdtree_Interface_3d<Point>} which should be used when using 
2D and 3D points from the {\cgal} kernel. This is done since the points in the
kernel do not support changing their coordinates through direct access. 

\end{ccRefClass}
