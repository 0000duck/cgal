2.7 (29 Apr 2002)
     - split of user and reference manuals

2.6 (04 Apr 2002)

     - Changed details to get rid of spurious negative (small) timing
       and precision results which I attribute to problems with
       different rounding behavior of double and inline code in different
       places (but just a hunch).

2.5 (25 Mar 2002)

     - Moved #include <float.h> in Timer.C to get always included.

2.4 (21 Mar 2002)

     - Maintenance moved to Lutz Kettner, MPI Saarbruecken.

2.3 (20 Mar 2002)

     - Added missing float.h file to include/CGAL/Real_timer.h.

2.2 (18 Mar 2002)

     - Improved Timer based on getrusage() on POSIX systems (does
       not wrap around after 30 minutes).
     - Error behaviour of both timer classes changed to warning
       and proper error return values.
     - Rewritten test program (more modular, since both timers are so similar.
     - Cleanup at some places, all based on one system depending function
       returning a time in seconds in one double.
     - Changed the precision function to compute the precision dynamically
       at runtime at its first invocation.

1.1 (05 Mar 1999)

     Standard headers, std namespace and CGAL namespace.
     This new package is spawned from the old Support_LK package
     1.18 (07 Oct 1998). Timer.h and Real_timer.h are here separated 
     in their own package to reflect that they have their own chapter
     in the manual.
