Given a set $\mathcal{C}$ of planar curves, the {\em arrangement}
${\mathcal A}({\mathcal C})$ is the subdivision of the plane induced
by the curves in $\mathcal{C}$ into maximally connected cells. The cells
can be $0$-dimensional ({\em vertices}), $1$-dimensional ({\em edges})
or $2$-dimensional ({\em faces}). The {\em planar map} of ${\mathcal
A}({\mathcal C})$ is the embedding of the arrangement as a planar
graph, such that each arrangement vertex corresponds to a planar
point, and each edge corresponds to a planar subcurve of one of the
curves in ${\mathcal C}$.
The class \ccc{Arrangement_2<Traits,Dcel>} is a data structure that maintains
arrangements in the plane. In particular, the data structure maintains a
planar map perhaps with its features exsented with additional information.
