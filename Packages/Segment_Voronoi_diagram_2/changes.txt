- fix bug in insert_segment in Segment_Voronoi_diagram_2.C

30 May 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- added test suite for one-level and hierarchy algorithms
Documentation:
- added spec for the draw_dual_edge method that takes an edge circulator
- added specs for the draw_dual_edge method that takes an edge
  iterator (either All_edges_iterator or Finite_edges_iterator)
- removed preconditions that were not preconditions in draw_dual_edge
Code:
- Segment_Voronoi_diagram_2 class: added draw_dual_edge methods
  that take edge iterators and circulators
- Segment_Voronoi_diagram_2 class: fixed bug in swap method
- Segment_Voronoi_diagram_2 class: fixed bug in insertion of a segment
- Segment_Voronoi_diagram_2 class: renamed the ds() method to
  data_structure() so that it conforms with the doc
- Segment_Voronoi_diagram_2 class: added code for copy constructor and
  assignment operator
- Simple_container_wrapper class: added type for const_iterator
- Simple_container_wrapper class: added begin() and end() methods
- fixed bug in traits related to the usage Filtered_exact as the
  number type
- added constructor in hierarchy that takes two input interators
- fixed bugs in copy constructor, assignment operator and swap method
  of the segment Voronoi hierarchy class

27 May 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- added the method
     Vertex_handle  insert(const Site_2& t, Vertex_handle vnear);
  in the Segment_Voronoi_diagram_2 class
- added two methods in storage site: source_site() and target_site()
- added support for overlapping segments (both one-level and
  hierarchy)
- fixed bug in finite edge interior (wrong answer when a Voronoi edge
  was degenerate and a point was touching the single Voronoi circle)
- added macros in Svd_Voronoi_vertex_*_C2.h to indicate a change on
  how the incircle test is computed in a limiting case

25 May 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- added support for point that lies on a segment and segments that
  go through a point in the hierarchy code

24 May 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- finished implementation of the Arrangement_type_2 predicate with
  all the degenerate cases and using the enumeration type
- added support for point that lie on a segment and segments that go
  through a point (only one-level algorithm)
- bug fix: constructor of Site_2 was called but now there are no
  such constructors
- bug fix: Are_parallel_2 was not working in
  Segment_Voronoi_diagram_traits_base_2.h

21 May 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
Documentation:
- removed the template paramater PC from most of the doc
- removed the ITag template parameter in the doc; as a result new
  classes where added
- removed the Simple_container related stuff
- made other minor changes suggested by Sylvain
Code:
- added concept checking for the Method_tag for the traits classes
- removed the second template parameter from the two storage site
  classes; the paramater was useless since the Point_handle type is
  now hard-coded

13 May 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- removed the internally used macro USE_SC
- re-added code that was removed in the presence of g++-2.95.3; this
  was possible after the May 6 changes that removed template-template
  code
- moved all methods to be inlined from Segment_Voronoi_diagram_2.C and
  Segment_Voronoi_diagram_hierarchy_2.C to the corresponding .h files;
  this was done in order to please the SunPro CC-5.30 compiler
- moved initialization of UNDEFINED_LEVEL inside the class; again to
  please the SunPro CC-5.30 compiler

10 May 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- removed unreachable break statements to avoid pgCC warning
- removed excessive >'s in filtered traits (SunPro specific part)

6 May 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- fixed bugs for SunPro CC compiler:
  1. removed template-template code
  2. fixed problem with default template parameters for filtered traits

3 May 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- added support for filtering through Filtered_exact

2 May 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- forgot to submit correct version of
  predicates/Segment_Voronoi_diagram_predicates_ftC2.h in which
  the construct_site_2 static method is used for constructing
  sites instead of a constructor

26 April 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- removed duplicate definition of one of the operator()'s in
  the Construct_svd_site_2 functor.

22 April 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- replaced the site constructors by static methods that create
  the sites
- added functors for some predicates that did not have
- removed the macro USE_SET_METHODS
- removed unnecessary constructors from the various site classes
- the cartesian converter now makes use of the intersections tag
- fixed filtered traits to work with gcc 2.95.3

20 April 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- rewrote code for filtered traits to improve efficiency;
  the traits functor do not go through the number type level now
- removed dependencies on the set_* methods of the site classes;
  this should make the site classes interface much simpler

18 April 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- added code for input and output sites iterator

15 April 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- the point container is not hardcoded
- the traits classes is now split in two different classes; there is
  no intersection tag as a template parameter
