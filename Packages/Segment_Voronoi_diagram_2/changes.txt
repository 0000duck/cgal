- rewrote code for filtered traits to improve efficiency;
  the traits functor do not go through the number type level now
- removed dependencies on the set_* methods of the site classes;
  this should make the site classes interface much simpler

- the point container is not hardcoded
- the traits classes is now split in two different classes; there is
  no intersection tag as a template parameter
