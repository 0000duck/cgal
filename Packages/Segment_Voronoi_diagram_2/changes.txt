- forgot to submit correct version of
  predicates/Segment_Voronoi_diagram_predicates_ftC2.h in which
  the construct_site_2 static method is used for constructing
  sites instead of a constructor

26 April 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- removed duplicate definition of one of the operator()'s in
  the Construct_svd_site_2 functor.


22 April 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- replaced the site constructors by static methods that create
  the sites
- added functors for some predicates that did not have
- removed the macro USE_SET_METHODS
- removed unnecessary constructors from the various site classes
- the cartesian converter now makes use of the intersections tag
- fixed filtered traits to work with gcc 2.95.3


20 April 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- rewrote code for filtered traits to improve efficiency;
  the traits functor do not go through the number type level now
- removed dependencies on the set_* methods of the site classes;
  this should make the site classes interface much simpler


18 April 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- added code for input and output sites iterator


15 April 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- the point container is not hardcoded
- the traits classes is now split in two different classes; there is
  no intersection tag as a template parameter
