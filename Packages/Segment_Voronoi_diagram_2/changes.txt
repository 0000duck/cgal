25 July 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- fixed numerical bug in computation of vertex map (removal procedure)

22 July 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- in Simple_container_wrapper: changed return type of find method from
  iterator to const_iterator

20 July 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- added copyright headers in demo files

18 July 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- prefixed macros with CGAL_

17 July 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- fixed bug in copy method: the bug was introduced by the change in the
  representation of the input sites container from an std::list to an
  std::set.

12 July 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- fixed wrong message for one of the buttons in the file toolbar (demo)
- the segment Voronoi diagram in the demo now inserts segments in the upper
  levels as well
- added find and remove methods in the simple container wrapper
- in demo:
  * all messages to std::cout are now sent to std::cerr
  * added support for site removal
  * removed unused code
  * input data are saved in files with .cin extension; the full description of
    the segment Voronoi diagram is saved in files with .svd extension and
    .hsvd extension (the latter is used for the hierarchy).
  * added data/ directory with sample input data
- Code:
  * moved some methods from .h to .C
  * the input sites container is now an std::set instead of an std::list; this
    was done because we want to efficiently insert/remove/search elements
  * added remove method: works only with sites that are input sites and not
    subsegments or points of intersection of inout sites; removal works in
    the hierarchy as well; the computation of the vertex map is still unstable
    and prone to numerical errors

26 June 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- doc: added Triangulation_data_structure, Vertex and Face types and tds()
  method; also added that the Segment_Voronoi_diagram_2 class is a model of
  the DelaunayGraph_2 concept.
- SVD class: Vertex and Face are typedefed from those of the TDS not the
  Triangulation_2 class

15 June 2005:
- added layout widget in demos including a label; messages about the actions
  taken are now printed on the label.
- added file menu in demos; used for file I/O.
- added about boxes in demos.
- fixed bug in file_{input,output}: the input sites container was not
  read/stored at all; now the input sites container is correctly read/written
  from/to the files.

13 June 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- changed messages/captions of the file toolbar of the demo programs for the
  segment and polygon Voronoi diagrams

11 June 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- VC 7.1 and Intel 8.1 in the their implementation of std::set, the types for
  iterator and const_iterator are different; this is not the case, however,
  for g++ 3.4 or g++ 4.0: in their implementation of std::set, the types for
  iterator and const_iterator are the same.
  This caused a bug in the file_output method, namely, Point_handle_less_than
  was not defined for const_iterators (i.e., const_Point_handle) for VC 7.1
  and Intel 8.1, but only for iterators (i.e., Point_handle).
  The fix is to define Point_handle_less_than only for const_iterators, since,
  according to the C++ standard, iterators are convertible to const_iterators.

5 June 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- Segment_Voronoi_diagram_2 and Segment_Voronoi_diagram_hierarchy_2: added
  methods file_input and file_output that read and write from and to a file.
  The data written consists of the sites (expressed through input sites) and
  the triangulation data structure; in the case of the hierarchy, the entire
  hierarchy is encoded.
- Segment_Voronoi_diagram_2 and Segment_Voronoi_diagram_hierarchy_2: added
  operator>> and operator<< that read and write from and to a stream;
  the methods file_input and file_output are used to implement the two
  operators.
- modified the test suite to test the above mentioned I/O functionality.
- fixed unused variable warnings when NDEBUG is defined
- updated documentation to reflect the newly added I/O functionality.

1 June 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- examples/svd-voronoi-edges.C: calls to mirror_vertex and mirror_index
  made through the faces are now made through the TDS

29 May 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- calls to mirror_vertex and mirror_index made through the faces are
  now made through the TDS

27 May 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- fixed bug in Filtered_construction class: the Exact_construction was
  called with its arguments in the wrong order

21 May 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- added tds() method that returns the triangulation data structure

19 May 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- added the types Vertex, Face and Triangulation_data_structure in the
  Segment_Voronoi_diagram_2 class; these types should also appear in the
  doc of the class

17 May 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- changed maintainer's email

13 May 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- added typedefs for result_type, argument_type and Arity in
  Svd_degenerate_edge_2 class; the operator() in this class was also made
  const

7 March 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- replaced calls to the vertex handle methods degree() and
  incident_{edges,faces}() by calls to the corresponding TDS methods that
  take the vertex as argument. This was done in compliance with the latest
  changes in the design of the Triangulation_2 software.

18 November 2004 Sylvain Pion
- g++ 3.4.[23] workaround.

4 October 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- fixed warnings for VC++ IDE mentioned by Andreas (a class was initially
  defined as a struct but a specilization of which as a class; now everything
  is a class)

22 September 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- added specializations of the non-filtered traits classes for the
  Filtered_kernel

20 September 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- added missing sites2.cin data file in examples/data directory
- added missing svd-join_split.* files needed for documentation of the
  segment Voronoi diagram data structure concept

9 September 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- added third example (in examples/subdir and in doc) that shows how
  to recover the data for the Voronoi edges.

7 September 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- Documentation & code: replaced Agds_2 by Tds_2

3 September 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- test_svd_2_et.C: in definition of sqrt for Gmpq, I qualified the calls to
  to_double and sqrt by CGAL::
- polygon Voronoi diagram demo: fixed bugs in class
  Segment_Voronoi_diagram_vertex_base_with_info_2
- pvd_typedefs.h: replaced SVD_data_structure_2 by AG_data_structure_2
- Square_root_{1,2}: fixes for g++-3.4 (essentially kept the code under
  CGAL_USE_ADL_FOR_NT and removed the alternative code)
- documentation: added chapter author

30 August 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- SVD_kernel_wrapper_2 : removed unused variable (it was creating warnings
  on some compilers)
- test_types.h : commented usused variable

28 August 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- moved split_vertex from Segment_Voronoi_diagram_data_structure_2 to TDS2
- replaced Segment_Voronoi_diagram_data_structure_2 (which is now obsolete)
  by Apollonius_graph_data_structure_2 (until a better name is found...)
- documentation: replaced references to the segment Voronoi diagram concept
  and model by the ones in the Apollonius graph package

27 August 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- fixed bug in hierarchy about calling the wrong version of insert_third

20 August 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- fixed bugs in copy constructor/assignment operator for the segment
  Voronoi diagram and segment Voronoi diagram hierarchy classes
- using std::list instead of std::set for the input sites container
- using replaced Triple by boost tuple in Site_rep_2

18 August 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- updated TODO list
- the input site container now contains handles instead of points: this
  reduces memory usage
- the input site container and point container are now sets instead of lists.
  I may have to change this and use lists again. The reason for this change
  is that sets automatically check whether the inserted item has already been
  inserted; with lists one has to do that explicitly and it is very
  inefficient.
- made the code a bit more memory efficient: storage sites are created at
  the top-most level and are passed throughout the various methods

17 august 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- changed the API for the storage site classes; changed the classes that
  were using them accordingly
- updated the specs to reflect the API changes of the last few days.

14 August 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- fixed bugs in the demo files that were introduced by the changes of
  August 13

  Segment_Voronoi_diagram_traits_base_2.h

21 May 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
Documentation:
- removed the template paramater PC from most of the doc
- removed the ITag template parameter in the doc; as a result new
  classes where added
- removed the Simple_container related stuff
- made other minor changes suggested by Sylvain
Code:
- added concept checking for the Method_tag for the traits classes
- removed the second template parameter from the two storage site
  classes; the paramater was useless since the Point_handle type is
  now hard-coded

13 May 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- removed the internally used macro USE_SC
- re-added code that was removed in the presence of g++-2.95.3; this
  was possible after the May 6 changes that removed template-template
  code
- moved all methods to be inlined from Segment_Voronoi_diagram_2.C and
  Segment_Voronoi_diagram_hierarchy_2.C to the corresponding .h files;
  this was done in order to please the SunPro CC-5.30 compiler
- moved initialization of UNDEFINED_LEVEL inside the class; again to
  please the SunPro CC-5.30 compiler

10 May 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- removed unreachable break statements to avoid pgCC warning
- removed excessive >'s in filtered traits (SunPro specific part)

6 May 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>

  2. fixed problem with default template parameters for filtered traits

3 May 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- added support for filtering through Filtered_exact

2 May 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- forgot to submit correct version of
  predicates/Segment_Voronoi_diagram_predicates_ftC2.h in which
  the construct_site_2 static method is used for constructing
  sites instead of a constructor

26 April 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- removed duplicate definition of one of the operator()'s in
  the Construct_svd_site_2 functor.

22 April 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- replaced the site constructors by static methods that create
  the sites
- added functors for some predicates that did not have
- removed the macro USE_SET_METHODS

- fixed filtered traits to work with gcc 2.95.3

20 April 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- rewrote code for filtered traits to improve efficiency;
  the traits functor do not go through the number type level now
- removed dependencies on the set_* methods of the site classes;
  this should make the site classes interface much simpler

18 April 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- added code for input and output sites iterator

15 April 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- the point container is not hardcoded
- the traits classes is now split in two different classes; there is
  no intersection tag as a template parameter
