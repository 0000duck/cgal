20 December 2004 Sylvain Pion
- Remove duplicated ccChapterAuthor.

18 November 2004 Sylvain Pion
- g++ 3.4.[23] workaround.

4 October 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- fixed warnings for VC++ IDE mentioned by Andreas (a class was initially
  defined as a struct but a specilization of which as a class; now everything
  is a class)

22 September 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- added specializations of the non-filtered traits classes for the
  Filtered_kernel

20 September 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- added missing sites2.cin data file in examples/data directory
- added missing svd-join_split.* files needed for documentation of the
  segment Voronoi diagram data structure concept

9 September 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- added third example (in examples/subdir and in doc) that shows how
  to recover the data for the Voronoi edges.

7 September 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- Documentation & code: replaced Agds_2 by Tds_2

3 September 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- test_svd_2_et.C: in definition of sqrt for Gmpq, I qualified the calls to
  to_double and sqrt by CGAL::
- polygon Voronoi diagram demo: fixed bugs in class
  Segment_Voronoi_diagram_vertex_base_with_info_2
- pvd_typedefs.h: replaced SVD_data_structure_2 by AG_data_structure_2
- Square_root_{1,2}: fixes for g++-3.4 (essentially kept the code under
  CGAL_USE_ADL_FOR_NT and removed the alternative code)
- documentation: added chapter author

30 August 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- SVD_kernel_wrapper_2 : removed unused variable (it was creating warnings
  on some compilers)
- test_types.h : commented usused variable

28 August 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- moved split_vertex from Segment_Voronoi_diagram_data_structure_2 to TDS2
- replaced Segment_Voronoi_diagram_data_structure_2 (which is now obsolete)
  by Apollonius_graph_data_structure_2 (until a better name is found...)
- documentation: replaced references to the segment Voronoi diagram concept
  and model by the ones in the Apollonius graph package

27 August 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- fixed bug in hierarchy about calling the wrong version of insert_third

20 August 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- fixed bugs in copy constructor/assignment operator for the segment
  Voronoi diagram and segment Voronoi diagram hierarchy classes
- using std::list instead of std::set for the input sites container
- using replaced Triple by boost tuple in Site_rep_2

18 August 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- updated TODO list
- the input site container now contains handles instead of points: this
  reduces memory usage
- the input site container and point container are now sets instead of lists.
  I may have to change this and use lists again. The reason for this change
  is that sets automatically check whether the inserted item has already been
  inserted; with lists one has to do that explicitly and it is very
  inefficient.
- made the code a bit more memory efficient: storage sites are created at
  the top-most level and are passed throughout the various methods

17 august 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- changed the API for the storage site classes; changed the classes that
  were using them accordingly
- updated the specs to reflect the API changes of the last few days.

14 August 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- fixed bugs in the demo files that were introduced by the changes of
  August 13

13 August 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
***************************************************************
*** Day of the opening ceremony of the Athens Olympic Games ***
***************************************************************

  with the spec; removed some methods not in the spec and modified the code
  wherever they were used.
- vertex base class: made some types that were not in the spec privat

12 August 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- made some more code conforming to the spec
- fixed bugs (due to yesterday's changes) that I forgot to fix

24 June 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- fixed bug in copy method of segment Voronoi diagram; added some debugging
  code with CGAL_NO_ASSERTIONS block
- fixed bug for the SGI compiler: it does not really like "using Base::member"

  about it

4 June 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- fixed bug in find_faces_to_split in Segment_Voronoi_diagram_2.C: the
  method was not working when the faces to be split were infinite
- added one more operator() in Svd_oriented_side_C2 (needed for the
  fix above) and propagated the change so that all traits and all
  filtering mechanisms can use it.

- fix bug in insert_segment in Segment_Voronoi_diagram_2.C

30 May 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- added test suite for one-level and hierarchy algorithms
Documentation:
- added spec for the draw_dual_edge method that takes an edge circulator
- added specs for the draw_dual_edge method that takes an edge
  iterator (either All_edges_iterator or Finite_edges_iterator)
- removed preconditions that were not preconditions in draw_dual_edge
Code:
- Segment_Voronoi_diagram_2 class: added draw_dual_edge methods
  that take edge iterators and circulators

- added the method
     Vertex_handle  insert(const Site_2& t, Vertex_handle vnear);
  in the Segment_Voronoi_diagram_2 class
- added two methods in storage site: source_site() and target_site()
- added support for overlapping segments (both one-level and
  hierarchy)
- fixed bug in finite edge interior (wrong answer when a Voronoi edge
  was degenerate and a point was touching the single Voronoi circle)
- added macros in Svd_Voronoi_vertex_*_C2.h to indicate a change on
  how the incircle test is computed in a limiting case

25 May 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- added support for point that lies on a segment and segments that
  go through a point in the hierarchy code

24 May 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- finished implementation of the Arrangement_type_2 predicate with
  all the degenerate cases and using the enumeration type
- added support for point that lie on a segment and segments that go
  through a point (only one-level algorithm)
- bug fix: constructor of Site_2 was called but now there are no
  such constructors
- bug fix: Are_parallel_2 was not working in
  Segment_Voronoi_diagram_traits_base_2.h

21 May 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
Documentation:
- removed the template paramater PC from most of the doc
- removed the ITag template parameter in the doc; as a result new
  classes where added
- removed the Simple_container related stuff
- made other minor changes suggested by Sylvain
Code:
- added concept checking for the Method_tag for the traits classes
- removed the second template parameter from the two storage site
  classes; the paramater was useless since the Point_handle type is
  now hard-coded

13 May 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- removed the internally used macro USE_SC
- re-added code that was removed in the presence of g++-2.95.3; this
  was possible after the May 6 changes that removed template-template
  code
- moved all methods to be inlined from Segment_Voronoi_diagram_2.C and
  Segment_Voronoi_diagram_hierarchy_2.C to the corresponding .h files;
  this was done in order to please the SunPro CC-5.30 compiler
- moved initialization of UNDEFINED_LEVEL inside the class; again to
  please the SunPro CC-5.30 compiler

10 May 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>

  1. removed template-template code
  2. fixed problem with default template parameters for filtered traits

3 May 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- added support for filtering through Filtered_exact

2 May 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- forgot to submit correct version of
  predicates/Segment_Voronoi_diagram_predicates_ftC2.h in which
  the construct_site_2 static method is used for constructing
  sites instead of a constructor

26 April 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- removed duplicate definition of one of the operator()'s in
  the Construct_svd_site_2 functor.

22 April 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- replaced the site constructors by static methods that create
  the sites
- added functors for some predicates that did not have
- removed the macro USE_SET_METHODS
- removed unnecessary constructors from the various site classes
- the cartesian converter now makes use of the intersections tag
- fixed filtered traits to work with gcc 2.95.3

20 April 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- rewrote code for filtered traits to improve efficiency;
  the traits functor do not go through the number type level now
- removed dependencies on the set_* methods of the site classes;
  this should make the site classes interface much simpler

18 April 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- added code for input and output sites iterator

15 April 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- the point container is not hardcoded
- the traits classes is now split in two different classes; there is
  no intersection tag as a template parameter
