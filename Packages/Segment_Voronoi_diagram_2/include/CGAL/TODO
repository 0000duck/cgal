- make correct the computation of the voronoi vertex for three
  segments
- check the various cases on the infinite_edge_test_2
- check for degeneracies in general
- check the case where a loop in the conflict region is created; such
  a case is when a point is adjacent to three segments forming a star;
  it is also possible that this case produces no conflict...
- change the svd_compare_distance function so that points outside the
  band of the segment have infinite distance; this creates however
  problems when we compare distance of a point from a segment and a
  point, and the point is not an endpoint of the segment...
