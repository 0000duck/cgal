\section{Examples}
\label{sec:segvor2-examples}

\subsection{First example}

The following example shows to use the segment Voronoi diagram traits
in conjunction with the \ccc{Filtered_exact<CT,ET>} mechanism. In
addition it shows how to use a few of the iterators provided by the
\ccc{Segment_Voronoi_diagram_2} class in order to count a few
site-related quantities.

\subsection{Second example}

The following example shows how to use the segment Voronoi diagram
hierarchy along with the filtered traits class that supports
intersecting sites.

\subsection{Third example}

The following example demonstrates how to recover the defining sites
for the edges of the Voronoi diagram.
