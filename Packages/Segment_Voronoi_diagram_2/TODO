- write a different class for the construction of the Voronoi vertex
  that does internal filtering
- write a different class for the Voronoi vertex for the predicates, that
  also has all the predicates
- check the case that s is a segment in the infinite_edge_conflict predicate
- in the traits class add Object_2 and Assign_2 as in the case of the Apollonius graph
- remove the constructions from the traits class except the ones for the Voronoi vertex
- verify that the infinite_edge_predicate is working correctly
- change the Square_root_2 class so that is does represent the product of the
  two square roots (drawback: multiplications are now not allowed)
- check whether it makes sense to use the fact that FG is a perfect square in
  the computations of the PSS Voronoi vertex
- modify the traits so that Compare_xy_2 is used instead of Compare_x_2 and
  Compare_y_2; remove the Are_same_points_2 predicate; add the necessary predicates
  so that the finite and infinite edge conflict predicates take a boolean instead
  of a sign as their argument
