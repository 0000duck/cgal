- change the return type of the do_intersect predicate (and potentially
  its name) to be a char instead of std::pair<int,int>; the char should
  encode the type of arrangement
- in the predicate classes, instead of the kernel's orientation use the
  orientation class taylored for sites (it does geometric filtering)
- in class Svd_basic_constructions_C2.h, inside method to_ft, check
  if sqrt is supported by the number type; actually this is ok for predicates
  but constructions also need to use this too.
- in the doc change the name of the template parameter for the
  point container from SC to PC.
- change the doc so that the requirement for the face base is the
  Triangulation_face_base_2 class
- add the methods insert_polyline and insert_polygon that do some
  optimized insertion for polylines and polygons; add these in both
  the one-level and hierarchy classes
- add the check for a segment intersecting an existing point and
  a point intersecting an existing segment.
