- rename all types without the _2 at the end to types that have the
  _2 at the end
- write a different class for the construction of the Voronoi vertex
  that does internel filtering
- write a different class for the Voronoi vertex for the predicates, that
  also has all the predicates
- write separate classes/methods for the Voronoi vertex, depending on the
  Method_tag
- use the Square_root_* classes to store the representation of the Voronoi
  vertex; maybe use different representation depending on the method tag
- collect all basic constructions/predicates (which appear now as static
  methods) into one or two classes; if two classes are used, then do one with
  constructions and then derive from that and do the predicates;
  also this/these classes should provide basic types
- check using Gmpq that when the ring tag is used that no calls to the
  sqrt function are permitted
- try to rewrite the filtered traits so that the non-filtered traits are used to get
  the various types/predicates etc.
- check the case that s is a segment in the infinite_edge_conflict predicate
- in the traits class add Object_2 and Assign_2 as in the case of the Apollonius graph
- remove the constructions from the traits class except the ones for the Voronoi vertex
- verify that the infinite_edge_predicate is working correctly
