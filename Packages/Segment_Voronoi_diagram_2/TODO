- remove the macros USE_STORAGE_SITE and USE_INPLACE_EDGE_LIST
- check if using an STL map in place of the Unique_hash_map, the edge
  list runs faster. Also check if the Edge_vector, Vertex_map and
  Face_map can be replaced by implementations using the
  Unique_hash_map of CGAL.
- fix the bug in insert_third for point
- add the check for a segment intersecting an existing point and
  a point intersecting an existing segment.

**************** OLD COMMENTS (with self-answers) ************************
- write a different class for the construction of the Voronoi vertex
  that does internal filtering
  ----> this should already have been done; look at Filtered_construction
- in the traits class add Object_2 and Assign_2 as in the case of the
  Apollonius graph
- check whether it makes sense to use the fact that FG is a perfect square in
  the computations of the PSS Voronoi vertex
- modify the traits so that Compare_xy_2 is used instead of Compare_x_2 and
  Compare_y_2; remove the Are_same_points_2 predicate; add the
  necessary predicates so that the finite and infinite edge conflict
  predicates take a boolean instead of a sign as their argument
  ----> removing the sign seems difficult; using Compare_xy_2 is not
  needed; in fact, I believe that even Compare_x_2 and Compare_y_2 are
  not needed...
