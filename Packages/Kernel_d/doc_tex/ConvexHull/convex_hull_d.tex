\section{dD Convex Hull}
\begin{ccPackage}{convex hull, dD}
  
  The class \ccc{CGAL::Convex_hull_d<R>} is used to represent the
  convex hull of a set of points in $d$-dimensional space.  This class
  supports incremental construction of hulls, and provides a rich
  interface for exploration. There are also output routines for hulls
  of dimension 2 and 3.
  
  The implementation follows the papers \cite{cms:fourresults-93} and
  \cite{BMS:degeneracy-94}.
