\subsection{Requirements for the Point\_set traits class}

A point set traits class has to provide some primitives that are used by the point set class
and that are not (yet) covered by the kernel traits.
The following catalog lists the involved primitives.
The types used in the traits class must have a copy constructor and an assignment operator.

\ccCreationVariable{ps_traits}
\ccTypes

\ccNestedType{Point}%
       {The point type on which the point set operates.}

\ccNestedType{Circle}%
       {The circle type on which the point set operates.}

\ccNestedType{Compare_dist_2}%
       {The primitive must provide 
	\ccc{Comparison_result operator()(const Point& p1,const Point& p2, const Point& p3) const}.
	The operator has to compare the distances of points $p2$ and $p3$ to $p1$.
        The operator returns \ccc{SMALLER}, if $p2$ is closer (to $p1$), \ccc{LARGER} if $p3$ is closer,
        \ccc{EQUAL} otherwise.
       }      
	
 \ccNestedType{Circle_bounded_side_2}%
	{The primitive must provide 
	\ccc{Bounded_side operator()(const Circle& c, const Point& p) const}.
	The operator has to return \ccc{ON_BOUNDED_SIDE} if $p$ lies on the bounded side of $c$,
	\ccc{ON_UNBOUNDED_SIDE} if $p$ lies on the unbounded side of $c$, \ccc{ON_BOUNDARY} otherwise.}
	
 \ccNestedType{Circle_center_2}%
	{The primitive must provide 
	\ccc{Point operator()(const Circle& c) const}.
	The operator has to return the center of $c$.}
