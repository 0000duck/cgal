\section*{Summary}

The two dimensional point set is a class for geometric queries.
It supports circular, triangular and iso rectangular range searches and
nearest neighbor searches.
The point set is inherited from the CGAL Delaunay triangulation data type.
That means that it is a dynamic data structure supporting the insertion and
deletion of points. Previous versions of the two dimensional point set class
were inherited from the LEDA graph data type storing its own Delaunay triangulation,
but to make the class independent from LEDA we switched to the 
CGAL Delaunay triangulation data type.
