- Moved \chapter to main.tex

2.3.13 new headers

2.3.12 Added #include <CGAL/squared_distance_2_1.h> to nearest_neighbor_delaunay_2.h  [af]

2.3.11 Added #include <CGAL/squared_distance_2_1.h> to Point_set_2.h  [af]

2.3.10 modified the demos to compile if the LEDA is not present

2.3.9  bug fix

2.3.8  and still more handle()s and *(& removed

2.3.5  Vertex::handle() no longer exists

2.3.4  second template parameter of Point_set_2 has now a default value

2.3.3  other pointer access using handles

2.3.2  the Unique hash map stores now Vertex_handles
       instead of Vertex* (necessary for VC)

2.3.1  docs changed (range_search variants added)

2.3    Unique_hash_map used
       new range_search variants added (not yet documented)
       some demos added

2.2.7  some changes in the demos

2.2.5  Susan moved Point_set_2_ref directory up one level

2.2.4  Susan made changes necessary for manual split

       and from manual
       small changes to examples and demos

2.2.1  manual changes
       some member functions removed from Point_set_2 class

2.2    function template versions for nearest neighbor queries and
       range searches added 

2.1.1  a shorter example program was added and is includet in the manual

2.1    manual changed
       kernel traits support improved

2.0.2  point_set_traits_2 removed (we need now only one geometric
       traits class)

2.0.1 range search example program changed
      some 'typenames' and a typedef added to Point_set_2.h  
      to please g++ with -pedantic compilation

2.0  The Point_set_2 class is now based on the CGAL Delaunay triangulation
     and needs no longer LEDA
