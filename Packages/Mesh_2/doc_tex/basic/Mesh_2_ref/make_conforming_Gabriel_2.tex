\ccFunction{ template<class Tr> void make_conforming_Gabriel_2 (Tr &t); } 
{ Conforms the constrained edges of \ccc{t} regarding the Gabriel
  criteria. After a call to this functions, all constrained edges of
  \ccc{t} have the \emph{Gabriel property}: the circle that have $e$
  as diameter doesn't contain any points from the triangulation.
  \ccPrecond \ccc{Tr} has to be a \cgal\ constrained Delaunay
  triangulation (CDT) and its geometric traits class must be a model
  of \ccc{ConformingGabrielTriangulationTraits_2}.}
