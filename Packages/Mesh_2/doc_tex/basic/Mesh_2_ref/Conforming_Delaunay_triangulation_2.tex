\begin{ccRefClass}{Conforming_Delaunay_triangulation_2<CDT>}

The class \ccRefName{} is an auxiliary base class of
\ccc{Delaunay_mesh_2<CDT>}. It permits to refine a constrained
Delaunay triangulation into a conforming Delaunay or conforming
Gabriel triangulation. For standard needs, consider using the global
fonctions \ccc{make_conforming_Gabriel_2} and
\ccc{make_conforming_Delaunay_2} defined in the same header.

\ccParameters 

The template parameter \ccc{CDT} has to be instantiated by a
\ccc{Constrained_Delaunay_triangulation_2<Gt, Tds>}, or a
\ccc{Constrained_triangulation_plus_2<CDT2>} or a
\ccc{Triangulation_hierarchy_2<CDT2>} where \ccc{CDT2} is a
\ccc{Constrained_Delaunay_triangulation_2<Gt, Tds>}. The geometric
traits class of the instance of \ccc{CDT} has to be a model of the
concept \ccc{ConformingGabrielTriangulationTraits_2}. This traits class
provides constructors and predicates needed by the conforming
algorithm.

Every methods of this class (but \ccc{clear()}) exists in two
versions: one suffixed by \ccc{_Delaunay} and one suffixed by
\ccc{_Gabriel}. If only \emph{Delaunay} methods are called, the
geometric traits class of the instance of \ccc{CDT} can be a model of
\ccc{ConformingDelaunayTriangulationTraits_2}, which is a lighter
requirement than the \ccc{ConformingGabrielTriangulationTraits_2}.

\ccHeading{Using this class}

A call to the method \ccc{make_conforming_Delaunay()}
(resp. \ccc{make_conforming_Gabriel()}) will refine the contrained
Delaunay triangulation into a conforming Delaunay (resp. conforming
Gabriel) triangulation. After that, if one inserts vertices of
contrained edges, the triangulation is no longer guaranted to be
conforming, until next call to a conforming method.

The conforming methods insert points into constrained edges, splitting
them into sub-constraints. You can have access to initial inserted
constraints if you instantiate the template parameter by a
\ccc{CGAL::Constrained_triangulation_plus_2<CDT>}.

\ccParameters

\ccc{CDT} must be a \cgal\ constrained Delaunay triangulation.

\ccTypes 
\ccTypedef{typedef CDT Triangulation;}{the triangulation base class.}

\ccCreation
\ccCreationVariable{c}

\ccConstructor{Conforming_Delaunay_triangulation_2(const Geom_traits& gt =
  Geom_traits());}
{Introduces an empty triangulation \ccVar.}

\ccOperations

\ccMethod{ void clear(); }
{ Clear the triangulation and private datas, resulting in a empty
  triangulation. }

\ccHeading{Conforming methods}

\ccMethod{ void make_conforming_Delaunay(); }
{ Refines the triangulation into a conforming Delaunay triangulation.
  After a call to this method, all triangles fulfill the empty circle
  property. }

\ccMethod{ void make_conforming_Gabriel(); }
{ Refines the triangulation into a conforming Gabriel triangulation.
  After a call to this method, all constrained edges $e$ have the
  \emph{Gabriel property}: the circle that have $e$ as diameter
  does not contain any vertex of the triangulation. }

\ccHeading{Checking}
The following methods verify that the constrained triangulation is
conforming Delaunay or conforming Gabriel. These methods scan the
whole triangulation and their complexity is proportional to the number
of edges.

\ccMethod{ bool is_conforming_Delaunay(); }
{ Returns \ccc{true} iff all triangles fulfill the Delaunay property.}

\ccMethod{ bool is_conforming_Gabriel(); }
{ Returns \ccc{true} if all constrained edges have the Gabriel property:
  there circumsphere is empty. }

\ccHeading{Step by step operations}

The \ccRefName{} class allows, for debugging or demos, to play the
conforming algorithm step by step, using the following methods. They
exist in two versions, depending whether you want the triangulation to
be conforming Delaunay or conforming Gabriel. Any call to a
\ccc{step_by_step_conforming_XX} function requires a previous call to
the corresponding of \ccc{init_XX}.

\ccMethod{ void init_Delaunay(); }
{ The method must be called after all points and constrained segments
  are inserted and before any call to the following methods. If some
  points or segments are then inserted in the triangulation, this
  method must be called again. }

\ccMethod{ bool step_by_step_conforming_Delaunay (); }
{ Applies one step of the algorithm. At one step of the algorithm,
  only one point is inserted. However, the algorithm sometimes doesn't
  insert a point at a step. Anyway, internal datas of the \ccRefName{}
  object are modified at each step, until \ccc{c.is_conforming_done()}
  returns \ccc{true}. If \ccc{c.is_conforming_done()}, returns
  \ccc{false}. If not (when the algorithm is not done), returns
  \ccc{true}.}

\ccMethod{ void init_Gabriel(); }{}
\ccGlue
\ccMethod{ void step_by_step_conforming_Gabriel (); }{Gabriel version.}

\ccMethod{ bool is_conforming_done(); }
{ Tests if the step by step conforming algorithm if done or not. If if
  returns \ccc{true}, the following calls to
  \ccc{step_by_step_conforming_XX} will not insert any points, until some
  new contrained segments or points are inserted in the triangulation and
  \ccc{init_XX} is called again. }
