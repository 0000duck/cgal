\begin{ccRefConcept}{MeshingCriteria_2}

\ccDefinition

The concept \ccRefName\ defines the meshing criteria to be used in the
algorithm. It provides a predicate \ccc{Is_bad} that tests a triangle
according to criteria. The return type of \ccc{Is_bad} is an enum
\ccc{Mesh_2::Face_badness}.

The possible values of \ccc{Mesh_2::Face_badness} are \ccc{NOT_BAD},
\ccc{BAD} and \ccc{IMPERATIVELY_BAD}. If the predicate returns \ccc{BAD},
the triangle is marked as bad and the algorithm will try to destroy it. If
the predicates returns \ccc{IMPERATIVELY_BAD}, the algorithm will destroy
the triangle unconditionally during its execution.

The termination of the algorithm is guaranteed when criteria are shape
criteria corresponding to a bound on smallest angles not less than
$20.7$ degrees (this corresponds to a radius-edge ratio bound not less
than $\sqrt{2}$). Any size criteria that are satisfied by small enough
tetrahedra can be added to the set of criteria without compromising
the termination.

Note that, in the presence of input angles smaller than $60$~degrees,
some bad shaped triangles can appear in the finale mesh in the
neighboring of small angles. To achieve termination and the respect of
size criteria everywhere, the \ccc{Is_bad} predicate has to return
\ccc{IMPERATIVELY_BAD} when size criteria are not satisfied, and
\ccc{BAD} when shape criteria are not satisfied.

% \ccc{IMPERATIVELY_BAD} 
% If some input angles are smaller than $60$~degrees, some triangles that do
% not satisfy the criteria could be not destroyed, with guarantees that the
% algorithm will terminate. This predicate should not returns
% \ccc{IMPERATIVELY_BAD} if the only reasons for the triangle to be destroyed
% are shapes criteria. The use of \ccc{IMPERATIVELY_BAD} should be restricted
% to other criteria, such as size criteria.

\ccRefName\ also provides a type \ccc{Quality} designed to code a quality
measure for triangles.  The type \ccc{Quality} must be \emph{less-than
  comparable} as the meshing algorithm will order bad triangles by quality,
to split those with smallest quality first. The predicate \ccc{Is_bad}
computes the quality of the triangle as a by-product.

\ccTypes

\ccNestedType{Face_handle}{Handle to a face of the triangulation.}

\ccNestedType{Quality}{Copy constructible, assignable, and less-than
  comparable type.}

\ccNestedType{Is_bad} {Predicate object. Must provide two operators. The
  first operator \ccc{Mesh_2::Face_badness operator()(Face_handle fh,
    Quality& q)} returns \ccc{NOT_BAD} if it satisfies the desired criteria
  for mesh triangles, \ccc{BAD} if it does not, and \ccc{IMPERATIVELY_BAD}
  if it does not and should be refined unconditionally. In addition, this
  operator assigns to \ccc{q} a value measuring the quality of the triangle
  pointed by \ccc{fh}. The second operator \ccc{Mesh_2::Face_badness
    operator()(Quality q)} returns \ccc{NOT_BAD} if \ccc{q} is the quality
  of a good triangle, \ccc{BAD} if the \ccc{q} represents a poor quality,
  and \ccc{IMPERATIVELY_BAD} if \ccc{q} represents the quality of a bad
  triangle that should be refined unconditionally.}
