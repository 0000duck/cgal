\chapter{2D Meshes}

This package implements 2D unstructured triangular meshes. Given a
domain, with constraints, it constructs a triangulation conforming the
domain and satisfying shape and size constraints. Hence, this package 
use \cgal\ 2D triangulations\footnote{See \ccTexHtml{the \cgal\ Manual.}
{<a href="http://www.cgal.org/Manual/doc_html/basic_lib/Triangulation_2/Chapter_triangulation_user.html">the CGAL Manual</a>.}}.

Domains that can be meshed are \emph{planar straight line graphes}
(PSLG), which are sets of of vertices and segments such that all
endpoints of every segments are in the set and that segments intersect
only at end-points. Such a domain can represented by a \cgal\ 
constrained triangulation, whose constraints segment are the segment of the
domain.

The mesh class depends on one template parameter. It stands for a
\cgal\ constrained Delaunay triangulation which represents the PSLG
and becomes the base class. Its geometric traits class should not only
provide geometric objects and predicates for the triangulation, as
usual, but also define the geometric constraints that the triangles
have to satisfy.

The algorithm used to compute the mesh is the \emph{Delaunay
refinement}~\cite{s-mgdsa-00}.
