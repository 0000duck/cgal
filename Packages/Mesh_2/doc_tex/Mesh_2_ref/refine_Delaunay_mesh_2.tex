\ccFunction{ template<class CDT, Criteria> 
void refine_Delaunay_mesh_2 (CDT &t, const Criteria& criteria = Criteria()); }
{ Refines the defaults domain defined by a constrained Delaunay
  triangulation and no seeds into a mesh satifying the criteria
  defined by the traits \ccc{criteria}. The domain of the mesh
  covers all the connected components of the plan defined by the
  constrained edges of \ccc{t}, except the unbounded component.
  \ccPrecond The template parameter \ccc{CDT} must be a model of the
  concept \ccc{ConstrainedDelaunayTriangulation_2}. The geometric traits
  class plugged in the constrained Delaunay triangulation must be a model
  of \ccc{DelaunayMeshTraits_2}. The face plugged into the constrained
  Delaunay triangulation must be a model of the concept
  \ccc{DelaunayMeshFaceBase_2}. \ccc{Criteria} must be a model of the
  concept \ccc{MeshingCriteria_2} and \ccc{CDT::Face_handle} must be the same
  as \ccc{Criteria::Face_handle}. }

\ccFunction{ template <class CDT, class Criteria, class InputIterator>

                       InputIterator begin, InputIterator end,

                     { Same a the previous function, but the sequence
                       [\ccc{begin}, \ccc{end}] gives a set of
                       seeds points, that defines the domain to be
                       meshed as follow. The constrained edges of
                       \ccc{t} partition the plane in connected
                       components. If \ccc{mark=true}, the mesh domain
                       is the union of the bounded connected
                       components including at least one seed. If
                       \ccc{mark=false}, the domain is the union of
                       the bounded components including no seed. Note
                       that the unbounded component of the plane is
                       never meshed.
                       \ccPrecond The \ccc{value_type} of \ccc{begin}
                       and \ccc{end} is
                       \ccc{CDT::Geom_traits::Point_2}.}
