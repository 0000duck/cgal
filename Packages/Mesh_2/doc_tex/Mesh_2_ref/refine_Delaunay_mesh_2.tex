typename CDT::Geom_traits() ); }
{ Refines the defaults domain defined by a constrained Delaunay
  triangulation and no seeds into a mesh satifying the criteria
  defined by the traits \ccc{gt}. The domain of the mesh
    covers all the connected components of the plan defined by the
    constrained edges of \ccc{t}, except the unbounded component.
  \ccPrecond The template parameter \ccc{CDT}
    \meshcdtrequires{}. The geometric traits class plugged in the
    constrained Delaunay triangulation must be a model of
    \ccc{DelaunayMeshTraits_2}. The face base plugged in the
    constrained Delaunay triangulation must be a model of the
    concept \ccc{DelaunayMeshFaceBase_2}.}

\ccFunction{ template <class CDT, class InputIterator>

                       const typename CDT::Geom_traits& gt =

                     { Same a the previous function, but the sequence
                       [\ccc{begin}, \ccc{end}] gives a set of
                       seeds points, that defines the domain to be
                       meshed as follow. The constrained edges of
                       \ccc{t} partition the plane in connected
                       components. If \ccc{mark=true}, the mesh domain
                       is the union of the bounded connected
                       components including at least one seed. If
                       \ccc{mark=false}, the domain is the union of
                       the bounded components including no seed. Note
                       that the unbounded component of the plane is
                       never meshed.
                       \ccPrecond The \ccc{value_type} of \ccc{begin}
                       and \ccc{end} is
                       \ccc{CDT::Geom_traits::Point_2}.}
