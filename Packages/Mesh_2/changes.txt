- Conforming_Delaunay_triangulation_maker_2 renamed to 
  Triangulation_conformer_2.

17 October 2004 Laurent Rineau
- Attempt to fix remaining bug: the list of faces modified by the insertion
of a point on a segment is not the conflicts zone of the
point. remove_constrained_edge() and insert_constraint() flip some faces. I
have added a class Refine_edges_for_refine_faces that handles a special
member special_zone (bad name) which is a set of
faces. do_before_conflict() and do_after_insertion() deal with functions
remove_constrained_edge() and insert_contraint() and fill the set
special_zone. The visitor Refine_edges_visitor uses this set to remove
those faces from bad_faces in after_insertion() (before the two
sub-segments are added back by Refine_edges::do_after_insertion().
- However, this attempt fails! Seems that adding back the two
subconstraints intersects some other constrained edges already in the
triangulation.

12 October 2004 Laurent Rineau
- Added parents and names to every layers, so that Qt releases the memory.
- Added debugging functions in Delaunay_mesher_2, and new debugging 
  layers and buttons tools into demo/Mesh_2/mesh_demo. These functions are 
  not documented.
- CGAL::Mesh_2::Refine_edges now has Tr::Edge has Element type. It 
  decreases number of calls to Tr::is_edge().
- Removed debugging outputs to std::cerr.
- The step by step demo now display the edge of the face that will be refined.
- Modified Mesh_2::Clusters::get_cluster and Mesh_2::Clusters::update_clusters
  to fix a bug in debugging functions (can we call that a "meta-bug"?).
- Added a function check_bad_faces() in Refine_faces. For the moment, it
  checks that no bad face has three collinear vertices. It is used in a
  CGAL_expensive_assertion.

6 October 2004 Laurent Rineau
- Patch for gcc-3.4

29 September 2004 Laurent Rineau
- New code
- New layers in mesh_demo

30 August 2004 Laurent Rineau
- New specifications.

17 August 2004 Laurent Rineau
- Use namespace CGAL instead of CGAL_NAMESPACE_BEGIN/END.
- Insertion in an edge now reinstert the two sub-constraints, instead of
  using insert with Locate_type==EDGE.
- Boost iterators have changed.

09  August 2004 Andreas Fabri
Removed semicolons after closing parenthesis of functions, as they make problems for SunProCC

22 July 2004 Laurent Rineau
- patch a bug in Delaunay_mesh_2<Tr>: virtual_insert_in_the_edge was
  forcing the insertion of a point on a EDGE.

4 July 2004 Andreas Fabri
- In Delaunay_mesh_2: Removed const& on an object in a stack that gets popped before it gets used

1 July 2004 Laurent Rineau
- Added Extras in Delaunay_mesh_2<Tr, Extras> too.

28 June 2004 Laurent Rineau
- Move mark_facets functions from Delaunay_mesh_2 to
  Conforming_Delaunay_triangulation_2.
- Added a sort of hooks, through a template parameter "Extras", in
  Conforming_Delaunay_triangulation_2<Tr, Extras>. There is a default
  template argument that does nothing.
  These hooks help doing actions when points are inserted. Used in the
  package Mesh_3.

17 May 2004 Menelaos Karavelas
- replaced Point by Point_2 in the demo in order to resolve clash with
  the Mac version of Qt

6 May 2000 Laurent Rineau
- workaround for CC-5.xx, in include/CGAL/Delaunay_mesh_2.h

3 April 2004 Sylvain Pion
- Regenerate demo/example makefiles to remove debug options,
  which makes PGCC pass.

--------------------------
o submitted to the testsuite

version 0.9.4 (2003/10/9) [af]
--------------------------
o Bug fix in Is_locally_conforming_Gabriel and in Is_locally_conforming_Delaunay
o Removed redundant tests

version 0.9.4
--------------------------
o All names have changed.
o new concepts ConformingDelaunayTriangulationTraits_2 and
  ConformingDelaunayTriangulationTraits_2
o New internals and interface for Delaunay_mesh_2 and
  Conforming_Delaunay_triangulation_2
o updated documentation
o various changes in examples/ and demo/

version 0.9.3 (2003/05/10)
--------------------------
o internal release
o split of the code into Mesh_2 and Conform_2
o the demo mesh_demo can now displays clusters
o updated documentation (which is not really sync with the code)
o the interface of the demo has been improved

version 0.9.2 (2003/03/12)
--------------------------
o added a bench sub-directory
o fixed some gcc-3.2.1 compilation errors
o changes in the demo:
  - added a panel next to the widget, that shows currently the number of points
  - added a step actions'toolbar, improved with new buttons
  - fix some bugs
o changes in the example:
  - added some "Triangle-like" options
o changes in Mesh_2.h:
  - fix compilation errors with gcc-3.2.1
  - fix compilation errors when the number type is not double
  - the bound on size is no longer a squared distance

version 0.9.1 (2002/08/26)
--------------------------
o some code cleaning

o changes from Andreas Fabri, so that it works with VC++, and BCC:
  - Added many const& 
  - insert(Point, Point) -> insert_constraint to make it work 
    with the Triangulation_hierarchy
  - Added some typename
  - std::queue only works with std::list not with std::deque on VC++6
o added this file
o move Double_map.h in this package to remove dependency to Mesh_3
