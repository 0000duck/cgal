- Added many const& 
- insert(Point, Point) -> insert_constraint to make it work 
  with the Triangulation_hierarchy
- Added some typename
- std::queue only works with std::list not with std::deque on VC++6
- had to add Triangulation_ds_vertex_circulator::operator=(Self) for
  bcc. That means this CEP will not work with Rel 2.4 without patch
- Q: Can one change in Constrained_triangulation_2::limit_intersection
     plenty of const& for Gt::Line_2 ???
