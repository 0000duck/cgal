-pre-requisite 0: check out introspect, jet_fitting_3

-pre-requisite 1: introspect requires glut. under fedora, install
freeglut-devel. (wizards's corner: as root, use synaptic .. instead of
running a manual installation with rpm -i etc)


-in the introspec dir, a target lib allows to create a small archive,
libIntrospect.a, which can then be used from anywhere

-to use the library for/from any package:

*set INTROSPEC_DIR variable in the makefile, and use it for the
includes and the final link with -lIntrospect

*implement the SketchSample.cpp file, which tells how to draw the
geometry

*the main is in visu-test.cpp, which loads the geometry, and launches
the window

-> example: see visu-test.cpp in Jet_fitting_3
