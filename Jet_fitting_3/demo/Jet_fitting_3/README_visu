-pre-requisite: introspect requires glut. under fedore, install
freeglut-devel. (wizards's corner: as root, use synaptic .. instead of
a manual installation with rpm -i etc)


-in the introspec dir, a target lib allows to create a small
archive. then, libIntrospect.a can be used from anywhere

-to use the library for any package:

*set INTROSPEC_DIR variable in the makefile, and use it for the
includes and the final link with -lIntrospect

*implement the SketchSample.cpp file, which tells how to draw the
geometry

*the main is in visu-test.cpp, which loads the geometry, and launches
the window
