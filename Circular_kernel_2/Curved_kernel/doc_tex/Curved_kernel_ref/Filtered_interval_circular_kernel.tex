\begin{ccRefClass}{Filtered_interval_circular_kernel<CircularKernel>}

\ccDefinition

At first, this kernel uses an approximation of objects by bounding boxes to filter the 
computations. When the first approximation isn't sufficient to filter the intersect_2
functor, it approximates the solutions with more accuracy on operations using
interval arithmetic. (this works only with circular arcs and line arcs)

\ccIsModel

\ccc{CircularKernel}

\ccParameters

This filtered kernel is parameterized by (and derives from) a \ccc{CircularKernel}.
