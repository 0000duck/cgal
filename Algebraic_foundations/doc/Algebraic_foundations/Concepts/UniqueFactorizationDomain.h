A model of `UniqueFactorizationDomain` is an `IntegralDomain` with the 
additional property 
that the ring it represents is a unique factorization domain 
(a.k.a. UFD or factorial ring), meaning that every non-zero non-unit 
element has a factorization into irreducible elements that is unique 
up to order and up to multiplication by invertible elements (units). 
(An irreducible element is a non-unit ring element that cannot be factored 
further into two non-unit elements. In a UFD, the irreducible elements 
are precisely the prime elements.) 

In a UFD, any two elements, not both zero, possess a greatest common 
divisor (gcd). 

Moreover, `CGAL::Algebraic_structure_traits< UniqueFactorizationDomain >` 
is a model of `AlgebraicStructureTraits` providing: 

- `CGAL::Algebraic_structure_traits< UniqueFactorizationDomain >::Algebraic_type` 
derived from `Unique_factorization_domain_tag` 

- `CGAL::Algebraic_structure_traits< UniqueFactorizationDomain >::Gcd`
