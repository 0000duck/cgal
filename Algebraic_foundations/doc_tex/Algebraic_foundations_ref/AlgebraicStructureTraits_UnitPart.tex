\ccDefinition

This \ccc{AdaptableUnaryFunction} computes the unit part of a given ring 
element. 

The mathematical definition of unit part is as follows: Two ring elements $a$ 
and $b$ are said to be associate if there exists an invertible ring element 
(i.e. a unit) $u$ such that $a = ub$. This defines an equivalence relation. 
We can distinguish exactly one element of every equivalence class as being 
unit normal. Then each element of a ring possesses a factorization into a unit 
(called its unit part) and a unit-normal ring element 
(called its unit normal associate).

For the integers, the non-negative numbers are by convention unit normal, 
hence the unit-part of a non-zero integer is its sign. For a \ccc{Field}, every 
non-zero element is a unit and is its own unit part, its unit normal 
associate being one. The unit part of zero is, by convention, one.
