\section{Overview - TODO - OPEN Questions for Release 3.3}

\subsection{Overview}
{\em this section is for the reviewer and to be removed for the release. }

We introduced four traits classes and related concepts, for more details see 
section \ref{caf_ref::classified_refernce_pages}
\begin{itemize}
\item \ccc{Algebraic_structure_traits} reflects the algebraic concepts of a 
      type. e.g. \ccc{Field}, \ccc{EuclideanRing}
\item \ccc{Real_embeddable_traits} is use for number types that are embedded on 
      the real axis. 
\item \ccc{Coercion_traits}, reflects interoperability of types. 
\item \ccc{Fraction_traits}, more general than \ccc{Rational_traits}.
\end{itemize}

Number types, polynomials and linear algebra are not part of this package. 

OPEN:
\begin{itemize}
\item there is a problem with io stream operators for CORE types in case 
      gmpxx.h is included too. 
\end{itemize}

TODO:
\begin{itemize} 
\item add a new entry in the globally maintained Bib file.
\item extra review of \ccc{Root_of_2}
\end{itemize}

DONE:
\begin{itemize}
\item \ccc{FromSmallIntConstructible} -> \ccc{FromIntConstructible}
\item added concept \ccc{FromDoubleConstructible}
\item rm inexact version of \ccc{MP_float}. 
\item \ccc{utils.h} and \ccc{utils_classes.h} left in NTS\\
      contains: \\
      \ccc{min}, \ccc{max}, \ccc{is_valid}\\
      \ccc{Min}, \ccc{Max}, \ccc{Is_valid}\\
      TODO: mv to STL-extension\\
      TODO: wrap up STL-extension ! 
\end{itemize}

Remarks:
\begin{itemize}
\item old functions stay within code (but undocumented)
\item io support: keep \ccc{Output_rep} 
\end{itemize}

Keep in mind: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \ccc{mpf_class} is not supported yet. why not? is it possible?  
\item Should we add Ipower? motivation see introduction of Square. 
\item generic interoperable operators via Coercion Traits
\item may add arithmetic functors as Add, Sub to Algebraic Structure Traits
\item may add more fundamental concepts, such as Abelian Group.
\item The second operator of \ccc{AlgebraicStructureTraits::RootOf} is not 
        part of the concept, since the difference in the interface of the 
        according function provided by the two possible models \ccc{leda::real}
        and \ccc{CORE::Expr} is to large.  
\item can we do better for \ccc{mpz_class}, \ccc{mpq_class }
\item ToDoubleInterval etc. 
\item what about namespace of leda types ? 
     \ccc{leda_integer} vs. \ccc{leda::integer}
\item We had a quick look at \ccc{Nef_polynomial}. \\ 
      is it \ccc{RealEmbeddable}?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Changes}
\begin{itemize}
\item rm IsFinite from \ccc{RealEmbeddable} concept
      function \ccc{CGAL::is_finite} for float, double, long double 
\item Moved Max/Min/Is\_valid/Boolean\_tag.. to STL-extension 
\item mv \ccc{AdaptableUnaryFunction} and \ccc{AdaptableBinaryFunction} 
      to STL-extension
\item \ccc{Coercion_traits} replaces \ccc{Binary_operator_result}
\item \ccc{Algebraic_structure_traits} replaces \ccc{Number_type_traits} 
\item \ccc{Fraction_traits} should be used instead of \ccc{Rational_traits}\\
      \ccc{Rational_traits} is kept for backward compatibility.
\item gcd(0,0)=0, in particular gcd(x,0) is allowed now and is the unit normal 
      of x. For more details see \ccc{AlgebraicStructureTraits::Gcd}. \\
\end{itemize}


\subsection{some remarks on current status of number type}
\begin{itemize}
\item  \ccc{Interval_nt}\\
       consider \ccc{Interval_nt} as not exact
\item \ccc{Lazy_exact_nt}:\\
      Now supports all algebraic structures that are real embeddable.\\
      Supports \ccc{Coercion_traits< Lazy_exact_nt<A> , Lazy_exact_nt<B> >}\\ 
      From Rons email: The output behavior is not the same, as the internal NT. 

\item \ccc{Counted_number}:\\
        The type has been left undocumented.\\
        Implementation supports all algebraic structures, all functions are counted.\\
        Functors of \ccc{RealEmbeddable} are not counted. \\
        It's current implementation does not use the \ccc{result_type} of the used 
        functors. i.e. does not fully support \ccc{Interval_nt} as internal type.

\item \ccc{mpz_class}:\\
       Implementation supports expression templates, 
       up to the same level as the old CGAL implementation.       
       i.e. it is possible to call CGAL::square(x+x) but the result is 
       \ccc{mpz_class } and not the according expression template.  

\item \ccc{mpq_class}:\\
        same as \ccc{mpz_class}.

\item \ccc{Quotient<NT>}\\
        For an exact NT it is always a model of \ccc{Field}. (implemented)\\
        For inexact types it is a FieldWithSqrt in case the internal type has a sqrt.
        This is not implemented yet, since it is unclear what this sqrt is good for. 
        Since all inexact types with sqrt are Fields, and thus it make no sense to use 
        them as the internal type.  \\
        Supports \ccc{Coercion_traits}. 
\end{itemize}
