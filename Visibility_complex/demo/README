Two demos illustrating the Visibility_complex package.

*** visibility_graph
    Reads the 50 pairwise disjoint segments from the file "segments" 
    and outputs the bitangents of the visibility graph.
    The bitangents are in red and the segments in black.

*** shortest_path
    Reads the 50 pairwise disjoint segments from the file "segments"
    and outputs the shortest path between two corners of the window.
    The shortest path is in red and the segments in black.
