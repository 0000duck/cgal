\section{Design and Implementation History}

This package is clearly split into a univariate and bivariate kernel.
However, with respect to its history the package splits into a
design part and an implementation part.  The concepts, which make
up the design part, where written by Eric Berberich, Michael Hemmer,
and Monique Teillaud. The implementation part is currently comprised
of two univariate kernels that interface the library \rs~\cite{cgal:r-rs}.
These models were written by Luis Pe\~{n}aranda and Sylvain Lazard.

The design history of the package is fairly old and several ideas
that influenced this package can already be found
in~\cite{cgal:bhkt-risak-07}. Since then, the initial design underwent
considerable changes. For instance, it was decided that the algebraic
numbers should be under the control of the algebraic kernel. On the
other hand the initial support for polynomials was extended to a
separate and independent package that is not restricted to a certain
number of variables. Thus, the authors want to thank for all the
useful feedback and ideas that was brought to them throughout the
last years. In particular, they want to thank Menelaos Karavelas
and Elias Tsigaridas for their initial contributions.

The implementation history shall be considered as unclosed, since
there are some more models in the pipeline. So far, the package
provides two models of a univariate algebraic kernel. Both models
interface the library \rs~\cite{cgal:r-rs} by Fabrice Rouillier.
The authors want to thank Fabrice Rouillier and Elias Tsigaridas
for strong support and many useful discussions that lead to the
integration of \rs.
