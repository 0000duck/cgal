\begin{ccRefConcept}{AlgebraicCurveKernel_2}

\ccDefinition


The \ccc{AlgebraicCurveKernel_2} concept is meant to provide the curved
kernel with all the algebraic functionalities on bivariate polynomials
required for the manipulation of arcs of algebraic curves of general degree
$\R^2$ using an $y$-per-$x$-view on the curves.

\ccTypes

A model of \ccc{AlgebraicCurveKernel_2} is supposed to provide

\ccNestedType{Coefficient}{A model of \ccc{IntegralDomain}. }

\ccNestedType{Polynomial_2}{A model of \ccc{Polynomial_2}, for
  bivariate polynomials on an \ccc{IntegralDomain} coefficient type. 
  it must also be possible to perform \ccc{Canonicalize, 
    GcdUpToConstantFactor, 
    IntegralDivUpToConstantFactor, 
    MakeSquareFreeUpToConstantFactor, and 
    SquareFreeFactorizationUpToConstantFactor} on this type - maybe using a
  traits class. Also needed some PolynomialConstruction concept
} 

% TODO: Boundary: RealEmbeddable that is 'dense R'

\ccNestedType{Solution_2}{A model of
\ccc{AlgebraicCurveKernel_2::Solution_2}, for solutions of systems
of two bivariate polynomials of type \ccc{Polynomial_2}.}

\ccNestedType{CurvePairAnalysis_2}{A model of
\ccc{AlgebraicCurveKernel_2::CurvePairAnalysis_2}, 
for analysing a pair of curves
defined as two analyses of type \ccc{CurveAnalysis_2}.}

\ccNestedType{CurveAnalysis_2}{A model of
\ccc{CurvePairAnalyis_2::CurveAnalysis_2}, for analysing single
curves defined as bivariate polynomials of type \ccc{Polynomial_2}.}

\ccNestedType{Compare_x_2}{A model of the concept 
\ccc{AlgebraicKernel_d_2::CompareX_2}.}
\ccGlue
\ccNestedType{Compare_y_2}{A model of the concept 
\ccc{AlgebraicKernel_d_2::CompareY_2}.}
