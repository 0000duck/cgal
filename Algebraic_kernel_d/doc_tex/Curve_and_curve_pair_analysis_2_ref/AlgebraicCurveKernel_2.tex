\ccDefinition

The \ccc{AlgebraicKernelCCPA_2} concept refines the \ccc{AlgebraicKernelBase_2}
concept with functionality on bivariate polynomials
required for the manipulation of arcs of algebraic curves of general degree
$\R^2$ using an $y$-per-$x$-view on the curves.

Note that polynomails need to have some functionality. Due to that reason
we repeat these types here:

\ccNestedType{Polynomial_1}{A model of \ccc{Polynomial_1}, for
univariate polynomials when the \ccc{Coefficient} type is an 
\ccc{IntegralDomain}. It must also be possible to perform \ccc{Canonicalize, 
    GcdUpToConstantFactor, 
    IntegralDivUpToConstantFactor, 
    MakeSquareFreeUpToConstantFactor, and 
    SquareFreeFactorizationUpToConstantFactor. 
    Also needed some PolynomialConstruction concept.}

\ccNestedType{Polynomial_2}{A model of \ccc{Polynomial_2}, for

  it must also be possible to perform \ccc{Canonicalize, 
    GcdUpToConstantFactor,
