\begin{ccRefConcept}{AlgebraicKernelWithAnalysis_d_2} 

\ccDefinition

The \ccc{AlgebraicKernelWithAnalysis_d_2} concept refines
the \ccc{AlgebraicKernel_d_2} concept by interpreting bivariate polynomials
as algebraic curves and provides analysis of single curves and pairs of them.
By an $y$-per-$x$-view 
these analysis provide easy access to the topology of curves and pairs of
curves. If not stated otherwise, a model is required to 
provide the analysis for algebraic curves of general degree $d$ in $\R^2$.
