- IsCoprime, IsSquareFree, MakeCoprime, MakeSquareFree,
   SquareFreeFactorization - documentation needed as discussed in Inria

- Solve_2 - similar to Solve_1

- Polynomial - there are things to coordinate with PolynomialTraits
   and/or PolynomialToolBox, what about Construct_polynomial? 
   What about Derivative?

- Is Derivative and XCriticalPoints/YCriticalPoints redundant?


- AlgebraicReal_1 - what about the functions upper_bound, lower_bound
   etc. See .tex file!

- AlgebraicReal_2 - Do we provide .x() and .y() method??

- Names of CurveAnalysis_2, CurveVerticalLine_1 and
   CurvePairAnalysis_2, CurvePairVerticalLine_1?
- Improvements of Interface
- Improvements on Documentation
- Use "int" at all places, or stick to distinction of unsigned int + int?


Notes:
- CA_2 and CPA_2 require squarefree and coprime input! 
- Events at infinity are only important for a single curve. Since
   inf doesn't play a role in CPA_2 we discuss it as a special case in CA_2.
