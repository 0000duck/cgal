Tasks:
======

- IsSquareFree, MakeCoprime, MakeSquareFree,
   SquareFreeFactorization - What is the result_type, the type of
   the referenced parameter?

- Missing Doc for IsSquareFree_2, IsCoprime_2, MakeSquareFree_2,
   MakeCoprime_2, SquareFreeFactorization_2, Solve_2

- Polynomial - there are things to coordinate with PolynomialTraits
   and/or PolynomialToolBox, what about Construct_polynomial? 
   What about Derivative?

- AlgebraicReal_1 - refine: Absolute precision is useful, e.g., for
   drawing, we could also add relative refinement. 
   What about the "niceness" of lower/upper_bound/in_between?? Should
   they have low "complexity", in terms of bitsize?
   
- AK_1::SignAt removal?

Open questions:
===============

- Does AK_1 provide an FT ?

- IT ? and if is IT == Coefficient ?

- Is Derivative and XCriticalPoints/YCriticalPoints redundant?

- AlgebraicReal_2 - Do we provide .x() and .y() method??

- Names of CurveAnalysis_2, CurveVerticalLine_1 and
   CurvePairAnalysis_2, CurvePairVerticalLine_1?
- Use "int" at all places, or stick to distinction of unsigned int + int?
- Improvements of interface?
- Improvements on documentation?


Notes:
======
- CA_2 and CPA_2 require squarefree and coprime input! 
- Events at infinity are only important for a single curve. Since
   inf doesn't play a role in CPA_2 we discuss it for the sake of
   simplicity as a special case in CA_2 only.
