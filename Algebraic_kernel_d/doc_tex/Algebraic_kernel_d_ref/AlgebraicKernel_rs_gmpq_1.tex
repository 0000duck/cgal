\label{Algebraic_kernel_rs_gmpq_1}

\ccDefinition

This univariate algebraic kernel uses the \rs~library to perform
rational univariate polynomial root isolation. It is a model of the
\ccc{AlgebraicKernel_d_1} concept. Due to the fact that \rs~can only
isolate integer polynomials, the operations of this kernel have the
overhead of converting the polynomials to integer.

\ccTypes \ccThree{}{+++++++++++++}{++++++++}

\ccNestedType{Coefficient}{It is a typedef to \ccc{CGAL::Gmpq}.}

\ccNestedType{Polynomial_1}{It is defined as \ccc{CGAL::Polynomial<CGAL::Gmpq>}.}

\ccNestedType{Algebraic_real_1}{Type that represents the real roots of
integer univariate polynomials, containing a pointer to the polynomial of
which the represented algebraic number is root and and a \ccc{CGAL::Gmpfi}
isolating interval.}

\ccNestedType{Bound}{Since the isolating intervals of the roots have type
\ccc{CGAL::Gmpfi}, the bounds have type \ccc{CGAL::Gmpfr}.}

\ccNestedType{Multiplicity_type}{The multiplicity is an \ccc{int}.}
