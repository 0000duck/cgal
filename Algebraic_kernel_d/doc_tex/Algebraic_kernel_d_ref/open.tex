\subsection{open}
\begin{itemize}
\item Missing Doc for IsSquareFree\_2, IsCoprime\_2, MakeSquareFree\_2,
   MakeCoprime\_2, Solve\_2
\item revise doc of AK\_1 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{done} 
\begin{itemize}
\item MakeCoprime: changed return type to bool\\
      because IsCoprime is almost as costly as computing the coprime parts iff the polynomials are not coprime. This avoids caching. 
\item all functors for \ccc{PolynomialTraits\_d} \ccc{PolynomialToolBox\_d}
      are documented.
\item added \ccc{SquareFreeFactorization_1}
\item added \ccc{AlgebraicKernel_1::SignAt_1} 
\end{itemize}


\section{Questions}
\subsection{Open}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Does AK\_1 provide an FT ?
 \item IT ? and if is IT == Coefficient ?
 \item Is Derivative and XCriticalPoints/YCriticalPoints redundant?\\
       Michael: I think we should keep it, since it is more abstract than $solve(derivative(p),p)$.  This would again move the {\em AlgebraicKernel} towards a more abstract layer. 
 \item AlgebraicReal\_2 - Do we provide .x() and .y() method??\\
       Michael: Since in this case two y values at differnt x values must be comparable as well, it seems hard (costly) to provide this.  
 I don't like this idea.  

 \item Names of CurveAnalysis\_2, CurveVerticalLine\_1 and
   CurvePairAnalysis\_2, CurvePairVerticalLine\_1?
 \item Use "int" at all places, or stick to distinction of unsigned int + int?
 \item others?
\end{itemize}


\section{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
 \item CA\_2 and CPA\_2 require squarefree and coprime input! 
 \item Events at infinity are only important for a single curve. Since
   inf doesn't play a role in CPA\_2 we discuss it for the sake of
   simplicity as a special case in CA\_2 only. 
\item AlgebraicReal\_1 - refine: with relative precision is enough. \\
      Moreover, you can use 'refine() until' for absolut prec.
\item SquareFreeFactorization is not returning an additional constant 
      factor. This prevents us from providing an extra interface for 
      algebraic coefficients.
\end{itemize}
