\ccDefinition
Computes a square-free factorization of an
\ccc{AlgebraicKernel_d_2::Polynomial_2}.

A polynomial $p$ is factored into square-free and pairwise 
coprime non-constant factors $g_i$ with multiplicities $m_i$ 
and a constant factor $a$, such that 
$p = a  \cdot  g_1m_1  \cdot  ...  \cdot  g_nm_n$.

The provided operator returns the number of factors $n$.
The factors $g_i$ and multiplicities $m_i$ are written through the 
output iterator. 
The constant factor $a$ is not computed.

A model \ccVar\ of this type must provide:

\ccMethod{template < class OutputIterator >
    int
    operator()(const AlgebraicKernel_d_2::Polynomial_2 & p, 
               OutputIterator res);}
{Copies in the output iterator the factors of a square-free 
factorization of \ccc{p}, with their multiplicity, as objects of type 
\ccc{std::pair< AlgebraicKernel_d_2::Polynomial_2, int>}.}
