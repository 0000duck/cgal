\cgalPkgDesc{Real solving of polynomials is a fundamental problem with a wide application range.  This package is targeted to provide black-box implementations of state-of-the-art  algorithms to determine, compare and approximate real roots of univariate polynomials and bivariate polynomial systems. Such a black-box is called an *Algebraic %Kernel*.  So far the package only provides models for the univariate kernel. Nevertheless,  it already defines concepts for the bivariate kernel, since this settles the interface for upcoming implementations.}
