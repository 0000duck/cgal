INSTALL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file describes how to install CGAL.

The documentation of CGAL is available in PDF and HTML formats.
It is not bundled with the software but can be downloaded separately
at <http://www.cgal.org/Manual>.

For more information about CGAL, see the <http://www.cgal.org/>.


To install CGAL, you should:

 ---------------------------
 - Setup the pre-requisites:
 ---------------------------

     Required Rel 2.4-patch-7, 
     Recommended Rel 2.6 supporting a crossplatform cmake-gui
     Download from: http://www.cmake.org/

   * Install the Boost libraries (http://www.boost.org/ or http://www.boostpro.com/products/free)
     Boost is required to build CGAL.
     Compiled parts of Boost are mostly optional, except Boost.Threads.
     Another recommended compiled part is Boost.ProgramOptions.

   * Install optional additional libraries:

 - Configure the CGAL libraries
 ------------------------------

    CMake is a "makefile generator".  It does not build the library but generates the
    makefiles (or solution files) needed to build it, a process called "configuration".

    CMake configures the library by detecting your development environment, the location
    and requirements of the third-party libraries used by CGAL (such as BOOST), and
    the variations you can choose, such as building release or debug versions.

    In most cases, CMake can do all that unattended.  If you get any errors when
    running CMake OR when building the library, always run CMake again for
    a second time (sometimes the configuration needs more than one pass).  If that doesn't
    help, try deleting the file CMakeCache.txt (in the directory where CMake is run)
    and try again.  If that still doesn't work, you need to tell CMake something
    about your system, such as the location of a third-party library.  In that case, please
    refer to the section "Configuration Variables" later on.

    The third-party libraries needed by CGAL are detailed in the install notes at
    <http://www.cgal.org/Manual/doc_html/installation_manual/contents.html>.

    After CMake has been installed, it is useful to define the environment variable CMAKE_ROOT
    indicating the installation folder for CMake.  Theoretically, when this variable is not
    already defined, CMake will try to define it automatically based on the
    path of the executing cmake binary, but this has been reported to fail in some cases.

    ------ in source configuration ------

    In the simplest typical case, just cd into the CGAL root folder
    and run the following command

       cmake .    (notice the "current directory" argument)

    That will generate the makefiles/solution-files and a lot of intermediate files right
    there in the source tree.

    ------ out of source configuration ------

    In the "in source configuration" mode, CMake does not directly support
    multiple configurations at the same time (such as different compilers,
    release/debug mode, etc.).
    On the other hand, CMake generates the makefiles/solution-files and any
    intermediate files in the directory where it is invoked, and it can refer to
    sources in a different folder.  Therefore, in order to build different
    configurations of CGAL you need to:

      create a folder for each configuration, say

        mkdir release

      and from within that folder run CMake:

        cd release
        cmake <path-to-cgal-root>

--------------------------------------
- Build and install the CGAL libraries
--------------------------------------

  By default, CMake will not generate installation rules unless explicitly
  requested via the -DWITH_INSTALL=TRUE setting.

  ------ Mac/Unix/Linux ------

  To build the libraries, just run 'make' from the configuration folder
  (which would be the CGAL root folder if in source configuration was used).

  If you wish to install the libraries in your system run 'make install'.
  The installation directory must have been defined at configuration time by
  running CMake with -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<dir>.  By default it is /usr/local.

  You can define the variable DESTDIR to prepend CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX if needed.
  For instance, given the default install prefix, the command:

    make install DESTDIR=$HOME/testing

  will install under $HOME/testing/usr/local

  ------ Windows and Visual C++ ------

  Under Windows CMake will generate a CGAL.sln solution file which you can
  load and build via the VS IDE, or by running the following command in a DOS prompt:

    devenv CGAL.sln /Build Debug

  The "Debug" argument is needed because CMake creates solution files with
  all four configurations and you need to explicitly choose one when building
  (the other choices are Release, RelWithDebInfo and MinSizeRel).

  ------ Cygwin and gcc ------

  You can use cygwin to build with gcc.  To do that you need the cygwin
  version of CMake (run CMake without arguments and check that UNIX Makefiles
  are supported to confirm this is the cygwin version of CMake).
  In this case it all works as in any other POSIX environment, so just type
  'make' to build the libraries and 'make install' to install it.

  ------ Cygwin and Visual C++ ------

  You can also use CMake to build with Visual C++ but under cygwin.  To do that, you
  need the windows version of CMake and the environment properly setup for the
  command line version of VC.

  From within cygwin, run CMake without arguments and check that NMake Makefiles
  are supported to confirm this is NOT the cygwin version of CMake (and if necessary,
  arrange the order of directories in $PATH to make sure the right one is used).

  Edit the cygwin.bat launcher and add a call to the vsvars32.bat that corresponds
  to the chosen VC version before 'bash' is invoked.  This ensures the environment
  is properly setup for command line VC.
  NOTE: DO NOT just call vsvars32.bat from the bash shell within cygwin, since none of the
  environment variables defined there will be visible outside the .bat, and when CMake
  is called from cygwin but without the VC command line environment properly set, cl.exe
  might be found nevertheless but it will not be correctly configured for building CGAL.
  Make sure the environment is properly set and the "link.exe" from VC is found instead of
  the link.exe from cygwin's g++ (arrange $PATH properly).

  If everything is setup correctly: CMake is the windows version and supports NMake Makefiles,
  cl, nmake and link are set in the path, and link is not cygwin's link.

  To build the libraries in this context you need to pass the option
  -G'NMake Makefiles' to CMake at configuration time (otherwise solution files
  will be created since this is the windows version of CMake), then just run
  'nmake' (instead of 'make').

  You can also run 'nmake install' to install the library.  In this case however
  you may want to install it under the Windows tree (outside cygwin), or within
  the cygwin FSH tree.  Since the windows version of CMake is used here,
  the default CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX will be "C:\Program Files\CGAL".  If you are
  running Windows Vista, 'Program Files' might not be accessible from cygwin so
  you might need to specify another Windows-style path.
  Alternatively, you can specify a Unix-style path such as -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local.
  The CMake script will turn that into the right windows path (i.e. 'C:\cygwin\usr\local').


---------------------------------------------
- Configure and build applications using CGAL
- (such as demos, examples, etc)
---------------------------------------------

  * Define the environment variable CGAL_DIR to a given configuration folder.

        for example, if you built a debug version by running

           cmake ../../..

        under folder

          /<absolute-path-to-CGAL>/cmake/platforms/debug

        type

          export CGAL_DIR=/<absolute-path-to-CGAL>/cmake/platforms/debug

          (or use the appropriate dialog in Windows)


  * cd into the folder containing the CGAL application.

        for example:

        cd /<absolute-path-to-CGAL>/demo/Alpha_shapes_2

  * run CMake "in-source" (passing the current folder as argument)

        cmake .  (pass -G'NMake Makefiles' if using cygwin+VC as explained before)

  * build the application

     Mac/UNIX/Linux/Cygwin+gcc: make
     Cygwin+VC                : nmake
     Windows via VS IDE       : Load and build Alpha_shapes_2_demo.sln
     Windows via a DOS prompt : devenv Alpha_shapes_2_demo.sln /Build <configuration>


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Configuration Variables
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  There are a number of choices for building CGAL which are
  controlled by configuration variables.

  You can define any such variable in the call to CMake:

     cmake -DVARIABLE=VALUE <path-to-sources>

  Alternatively, you can run CMake in "wizard mode" via the "-i"
  command-line option, in which case CMake will ask you to
  confirm or override the default value of each variable.

  Also, you can run CMake in GUI mode in which case you can
  see and edit in a dialog all configuration variables before
  proceeding with the configuration.
  To do that run the GUI configuration editor  "cmake-gui" or "CMakeSetup".
  When the editor is launched press "configure" for the first time:
  all available configuration variables and their default values
  will be displayed on a red background.
  That red background tells you that the variable has been "seen"
  for the first time and you may wish to change its value.
  You can then override the default value of any variable
  (for example to fix the path to a NOTFOUND third party library,
  such as gmp, or to enable/disable a library such as CGAL_IMAGE_IO).
  When you are finished and all the displayed variables have the correct
  values press "configure" again.  All the previously displayed variables
  will show up now in a normal background, meaning that you have
  "accepted" their values.  There can be still variables with the "wrong"
  value (since the red doesn't mean it's right or wrong, only that
  it's new) so check again all variables.
  If any variable shows up just now (for the first time, in red),
  it means some previously accepted variable caused this one to
  become active; edit it, if necessary, or accept its default
  value by pressing "configure" once again.
  Once pressing configure doesn't result in new variables being displayed,
  and all variables have their correct value, press OK to proceed with
  the configuration.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Debug/Release variants
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The configuration variable CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE selects a "Debug" or "Release" build.
  The default value depends on the generator: for Unix makefiles it is
  undefined by set to Release, for NMake makefiles it is Debug and for Visual Studio
  Solution Files is undefined (and left undefined).

  If the generator is Visual Studio and CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is explicitly defined
  (there is no default in this case), the project files will contain only the configuration
  indicated, but if CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is left unset, several configurations will be included
  in each project file ("Debug,Release" for Visual Studio 2008 and
  "Debug,Release,MinSizeRelease,RelWithDebInfo" for older versions).

  If makefiles (UNIX or NMake) are used, there can only be one type of build
  per CMake call, thus, you need to use the "out of source" mode to build CGAL
  in both debug and release modes.  For example:

    cd /<absolute-path-to-CGAL>/cmake/platforms/debug
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..\..\..

    cd /<absolute-path-to-CGAL>/cmake/platforms/release
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..\..\..

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Static vs Shared libraries
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The configuration variable BUILD_SHARED_LIBS can be set to FALSE or TRUE to choose
  between static or shared libraries (respectively).
  If this is not specified, it defaults to static (FALSE) under Windows and
  shared (TRUE) under Linux.
  Note that we do not support shared libraries for CGAL under Windows.

  Note that CMake uses the term "Module" to refer to static libraries
  (this is relevant in the following section about linker flags).

  If you need to build both the static and shared libraries, you will need to
  use the "out of source" configuration mode with two directories.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Compiler and linker flags
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  CMake itself takes care automatically of most compiler and linker flags, depending on the
  target platform and build type via the following variables:

    Compiler flags:

      CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS          (common to all build types)
      CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE  (additional for release builds)
      CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG    (additional for debug builds)

    Linker flags:

      For static libraries:

        CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS
        CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS_RELEASE
        CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS_DEBUG

      For shared libraries:

        CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS
        CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_RELEASE
        CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_DEBUG

      For executables:

        CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS
        CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_RELEASE
        CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_DEBUG

  You can override any of these variables explicitly when calling CMake.

  Alternatively, you can define any of these additional CGAL specific flags which are
  *appended* to the general flags allowing you to override some of the
  general settings (i.e. those which might be overridden by specifying a subsequent flag)

      CGAL_CXX_FLAGS
      CGAL_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE
      CGAL_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG
      CGAL_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS
      CGAL_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS_RELEASE
      CGAL_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS_DEBUG
      CGAL_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS
      CGAL_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_RELEASE
      CGAL_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_DEBUG
      CGAL_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS
      CGAL_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_RELEASE
      CGAL_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_DEBUG

  These flags are defined at configuration time and their values are hard-coded into the
  "CGALConfig.cmake" file generated by running CMake.
  If you define these variables in the command line when executing CMake:

    cmake -DCGAL_CXX_FLAGS=/W2 .

  that value will be appended to the value defined in CGALConfig.cmake.

  For Visual C++, CGAL_CXX_FLAGS is defined as:

    "-D_CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE -D_SCL_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE -D_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS -D_SCL_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS"

  and CGAL_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE as "_D_SECURE_SCL=0"

  NOTE: Visual C++ Secure SCL is disabled in Release mode because it has
  been reported, for example here:

   http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lib.boost.build/17824/focus=173782

  that the overhead of the security checks are prohibitive
  for a computationally intensive framework like CGAL.

-------------------------------
- Running CMake multiple times
-------------------------------

  CMake maintains a file named "CMakeCache.txt" in the "binary directory"
  (where CMake is run) which records all configuration variables.
  These cached values are used on subsequent runs of CMake on the same configuration thus
  it is sometimes better to delete the cache before running CMake again.
  This is particularly important whenever the environment has changed, for example,
  Boost or GMP was just installed or moved after a previous configuration.
