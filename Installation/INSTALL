$CGAL/INSTALL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file describes how to install CGAL on Unix or Unix-like systems
such as Linux, Solaris, Irix, and Cygwin on Windows. For installation
under Windows using native tools, see INSTALL.win32.

The documentation of CGAL is available in various formats (HTML, PostScript,
PDF). It is not bundled with the software but can be downloaded separately at
<http://www.cgal.org/Manual>.

For more information about CGAL, see the URL <http://www.cgal.org/>.

To install CGAL, you should:

 - download the compressed archive file from the CGAL web site www.cgal.org

 - unpack the file

 - build and install the CGAL libraries by running
        "./install_cgal --prefix=/usr/local" to install CGAL in /usr/local
              (or where ever else is desired)
        or,  for an interactive installer run "./install_cgal -i"
    Either way the installer will try to locate the libraries used
    and required by CGAL. These libraries are detailed in the CGAL
    install notes at 
    <http://www.cgal.org/Manual/doc_html/installation_manual/contents.html>.
