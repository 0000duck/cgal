\section{Introduction}


The goal of the \cgal, the \textit{Computational Geometry Algorithms Library}
 Open Source Project, is to provide {\em easy access to efficient and reliable 
geometric algorithms} in the form of a \CC\ library.

This document describes how to install \cgal\ on Windows, Unix-like systems and MacOS X.

Ideally, the installation reduces to

\begin{verbatim}
  cd  CGAL-3.4                                # go to CGAL directory
  cmake .                                     # configure CGAL
  make                                        # build the CGAL libraries
  cd examples/Straight_skeleton_2             # go to an example directory
  cmake -DCGAL_DIR=$HOME/CGAL-3.4 .           # configure the examples
  make                                        # build the examples 
\end{verbatim}
%%   $   This dollar is there to trick syntax highlighting in emacs 

In a less ideal world, you probably have to install \cmake, a makefile
generator, and third party libraries. That's what this manual is about.

\section{Prerequisites\label{sec:prerequisites}}

The focus of the \cgal\ project is on geometry, and we rely on other
highly specialized libraries and software for non-geometric issues,
e.g. for numeric solvers, or visualization.

\subsection{Compilers}

In order to build the \cgal\ libraries you need a \CC\ compiler.  
\cgal~3.4 is supported for the following compilers/operating systems:

\begin{center}\index{compilers!supported}\index{supported compilers}
  \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
  \gdef\lcTabularBorder{2}
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
    \textbf{compiler}        & \textbf{operating system}\\\hline\hline
    \Gcc{4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3} \footnotemark[10]
    & Solaris 2.6+ / Linux 2.x / MacOS X
      \\ & \mswin\ 95/98/2000/XP/NT4\footnotemark[11]\\\hline
    \msvc{8.0, 9.0} (\textsc{Visual Studio 2005 and 2008}) \footnotemark[12]
    & \mswin\ 95/98/2000/XP/NT4/Vista\footnotemark[11]\\\hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\footnotetext[10]{\gccurl}\addtocounter{footnote}{1}
\footnotetext[11]{\msvcurl}\addtocounter{footnote}{1}
\footnotetext[12]{\iclurl}\addtocounter{footnote}{1}

Note that neither prerelease versions nor repository snapshots of
\texttt{GCC} are supported.

\subsection{cmake}

In order to configure, build and install the \cgal\ libraries, as well
as the examples and demos, you need \cmake, a cross-platform ``makefile generator''.
If \cmake\ is not installed already you can obtain it from \cmakepage.
We recommend the usage of \cmake\ release~2.6, and you need at least
\cmake\ release~2.4-patch-7.


\subsection{boost}
Moreover, \cgal\ requires a working installation of the \boost\
libraries (the header files and the threading library binaries), 
Version 1.33.1 or later. In case
the \boost\ libraries are not installed on your system already, you
can obtain them from \boostpage. For Windows you can download an
installer from \path'http://www.boostpro.com/products/free'.
Since \texttt{Boost.Thread} is required, make sure to either install the precompiled 
{\em static} binaries for your compiler or to build \texttt{libboost-thread}.

Some demos depend on \texttt{Boost.Program\_options}.

\subsection{Exact Arithmetic}

\cgal\ combines floating point arithmetic with exact arithmetic, in order
to be fast and reliable.  \cgal\ offers support for \gmp+\mpfr\ and \leda\ 
exact number types, as well as a built-in exact number type used when
none of the other two is installed on your system. 

Having \gmp\ version 4.1.4 or later and \mpfr\ version 2.2.1 or later
installed is highly recommended. These libraries can be obtained from
\gmppage\ and \mpfrpage, respectively, if they should not be present
on your system. As Visual \CC\ is not properly support by the \gmp\ and 
\mpfr\ projects, we provide precompiled versions of \gmp\ and \mpfr.  

\leda\ can be found at \ledapage. There is a free and a commercial
edition for this library.


\subsection{Visualization}

Most demos use Trolltech's cross-plaform GUI toolkits Qt3 or Qt4.
In case Qt is not yet installed on your system, you can download 
it from \trolltechpage.

Some 3D demos use the libQGLViewer, which is a 3D widget for Qt4.
It can be downloaded from \path'http://www.libqglviewer.com'

\subsection{Miscellaneous}

The Surface Mesh Generator demo can read compressed image files
if {\em zlib} is installed. It can be downloaded from
\path'http://www.zlib.net'.

The Approximation of Ridges and Umbilics on Triangulated Surface Meshes
package as well as the Estimation of Local Differential Properties package
depends on the BLAS and LAPACK libraries. Implementations can be found at
\blaspage\ and \lapackpage. We provides precompiled versions of BLAS and
LAPACK for Visual~\CC.
                       
The Surface parametrization package can be speeded up by using the sparse matrix solver \taucs.
This library can be downloaded from \taucspage. As Visual~\CC\ is not properly
supported by the \taucs\ project, we provide a precompiled version of
\taucs.



\section{Downloading CGAL\label{sec:gettingcgal}}
\index{CGAL@\cgal!getting}\index{getting \cgal}

The \cgal\ library can be downloaded from  \path'http://www.cgal.org/download.html'.

After you have downloaded the file \texttt{CGAL-3.4.tar.gz} containing the \cgal\ library, you
have to unpack it. Under a Unix-like shell, use the command

\begin{verbatim}
      tar xzf CGAL-3.4.tar.gz
\end{verbatim}


When you are on Windows you may download and run the \texttt{CGAL-3.4-Setup.exe}. It is a
self extracting executable that installs the \cgal\ source and header
files, and that allows you to select and download some precompiled
third party libraries.

In both cases the directory \cgaldir\ will be created. This directory
contains the following subdirectories:\index{directories!structure}

\begin{center}
  \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
  \gdef\lcTabularBorder{2}
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
    \textbf{directory}     & \textbf{contents}\\\hline\hline
    \texttt{auxiliary}     & precompiled GMP, MPFR and TAUCS for Windows\\\hline
    \texttt{config}        & configuration files for install script\\\hline
    \texttt{cmake/modules} & modules for finding and using libraries\\\hline
    \texttt{demo}          & demo programs (most of them need \qt, geomview or other third-party products)\\\hline
    \texttt{doc\_html}     & documentation (HTML)\\\hline
    \texttt{doc\_pdf}      & documentation (PDF)\\\hline
    \texttt{examples}      & example programs\\\hline
    \texttt{include}       & header files\\\hline
    \texttt{scripts}       & some useful scripts (e.g. for creating CMakeLists.txt files)\\\hline
    \texttt{src}           & source files\\\hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

The directories \texttt{include/CGAL/CORE} and \texttt{src/CGALCore} contain a
distribution of the \core\ library\footnote{\corepage} version~1.7 for
dealing with algebraic numbers. \core\ is not part of \cgal\ and has its own license.


The directory \texttt{include/CGAL/OpenNL} contains a distribution of the 
Open Numerical Library which provides solvers for sparse linear systems, especially designed 
for the Computer Graphics community. OpenNL is not part of \cgal\ and has its own license.

\section{Configuring CGAL}

Before building \cgal\ you have to choose the compiler/linker, 
set compiler and linker  flags, specify which
third-party libraries you want to use and where they can be found, 
which \cgal\ libraries you want to build. Gathering
all this information is called {\em configuration}. 

For CGAL-3.4, the configuration is generated with \cmake, a
cross-platform build system.  This manual explains only those features of
\cmake\ which are needed in order to build \cgal. Please refer to the \cmake\ 
documentation at \cmakepage\ for further details.

When \cmake\ has finished the configuration, it has generated
a makefile or a Visual \CC\  solution and project file that you 
can use to build \cgal.

\subsection{Configuring \cgal{} with the \cmake{} {\sc Gui} }

The simplest way to start the configuration is to run the graphical
user interface of \cmake. We recommend to use \texttt{cmake-gui}, which
is available on all platforms since \cmake\ release~2.6.   You must pass as 
argument the root directory of \cgal. For example:

{\ccTexHtml{\scriptsize}{}
\begin{verbatim}
  cd  CGAL-3.4
  cmake-gui . # Notice the dot to indicate the current directory.
\end{verbatim}
}

Once \texttt{cmake-gui} has started up, you must press 'Configure'. 
A dialog will pop up and you have to choose what shall get generated.
After you have made your choice and pressed 'ok', you will see
the output of configuration tests in the lower window of the application. 
When these tests are done, you will see many
red entries in the upper window. Just ignore them and  press once again  'Configure'. 
By now \cmake\ should have found many libraries and have initialized variables. 
If you still find red entries you have to provide the necessary information. 
This typically happens if you have installed software at non-standard locations.
Providing information and pressing 'Configure' goes on until 
all entries are grayed. You are now ready to press 'Configure' and you
can quit \texttt{cmake-gui}.

 

\subsection{Configuring \cgal{} with the cmake command-line tool }

Alternatively, you can run the command-line tool called
\texttt{cmake}. You pass as argument the root directory of
\cgal. For example:

{\ccTexHtml{\scriptsize}{}
\begin{verbatim}
  cd  CGAL-3.4
  cmake . # Notice the dot to indicate the current directory.
\end{verbatim}
}


The very first thing \cmake\ does is to detect the compiler to use.
This detection is performed by a special \cmake\ module called a {\em generator}. A
\cmake\ generator understands the build requirements for a particular compiler/linker
 and generates the necessary files for that. For example, the 
{\em UNIX Makefiles} generator understands the GNU toolchain (g++,gcc,ld etc) and produces makefiles
which can be used to build a target by a simple call to \texttt{make}.
Likewise, the {\em Visual Studio 2005} generator produces solution and project files and can be manually
launched in the VS IDE to build the target.

Each platform has a default generator so you only need to select one when the default is
not what you want. 
For example, under Windows, it is possible to generate {\em NMakefiles}
instead of Visual Studio project files in order to build the library with \texttt{nmake}.
Running \texttt{cmake} with no parameters in a command-line prints the list of available generators supported 
by your platform and \cmake\ version. If the generator you need is not listed there, you can
try a newer \cmake\ version since generators are hardcoded into \cmake\ and more and
more generators are added with each release.

Since the choice of the generator determines the type of build files to generate, in some cases
you choose a particular generator as a mean to choose a specific compiler (because they use different 
build files). For example, the following generates solution files for use in Visual \CC\ 9.0:

{\ccTexHtml{\scriptsize}{}
\begin{verbatim}
  cd CGAL-3.4
  cmake -G"Visual Studio 9 2008" . 
\end{verbatim}
}

In other cases, however, the generator doesn't directly identify a specific compiler but a tool chain.
For example, the \texttt{UNIX Makefiles} generator produces \texttt{makefiles} that call some auto-detected
command-line compiler, like \texttt{gcc}. If you need the makefiles to use a different compiler you need to
say so in the call to \cmake{}, as in this example:

{\ccTexHtml{\scriptsize}{}
\begin{verbatim}
  cd CGAL-3.4
  cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER:FILEPATH=g++-3.4 . 
\end{verbatim}
}


\cmake\ maintains configuration parameters in so-called {\em cmake variables}, like the \texttt{CMAKE\_CXX\_COMPILER}
in the example above. These variables {\em are not environment variables} but {\em \cmake\ variables}. Some of the \cmake{} 
variables represent user choices, such as \texttt{WITH\_examples} or \texttt{CMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE=Release}, while others
indicate the details of a third-party library, such as \texttt{Boost\_INCLUDE\_DIR} or the compiler flags to use,
such as \texttt{CMAKE\_CXX\_FLAGS}. 

The command line tool \texttt{cmake} accepts \cmake\ variables as arguments of the form \texttt{-D<VAR>:<TYPE>=<VALUE>}, as
in the example above, but this is only useful if you already know which variables needs to be explicitly defined.

\begin{ccAdvanced}
\cmake\ keeps the variables that a user can manipulate in a so-called {\em \cmake\ cache}, a simple text file specifically 
named \texttt{CMakeCache.txt} whose entries are of the form VARIABLE:TYPE=VALUE. Advanced users can just manually edit this 
file instead of going through the interactive configuration session.
\end{ccAdvanced}


The configuration process not only determines the location of the required dependencies, it also dynamically generates a
\texttt{compiler\_config.h} file which encodes the properties of your system and a special file named 
\texttt{CGALConfig.cmake} which is used to build programs using \cgal\ (this file will be explained later).

\subsection{\cgal\ Libraries}

\cgal\ is split in four libraries in order to push some auxiliary 
functionality out of the main library. During configuration, you can select the libraries that 
shall be built by setting a \cmake\ variable of the form {\tt WITH\_<library>}. By default all 
are switched \texttt{ON}.

\begin{center}\index{cgal!libraries}\index{cgal libraries}
  \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
  \gdef\lcTabularBorder{2}
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|} \hline
    \textbf{library}       & \textbf{\cmake\ variable}    & \textbf{functionality}                                                & \textbf{dependencies}\\\hline\hline
    \texttt{CGAL}          & {\em none}                   & Main library                                                          & GMP, MPFR, Boost (headers) and Boost.Thread (library)\\\hline
    \texttt{CGAL\_Core}    & \texttt{WITH\_CGAL\_Core}    & The CORE library for dealing with algebraic numbers.\footnotemark[15] & GMP and MPFR\\\hline
    \texttt{CGAL\_Qt3}     & \texttt{WITH\_CGAL\_Qt3}     & \ccc{CGAL::Qt_widget} used by some old Qt3-based demos                & Qt3 and OpenGL\\\hline
    \texttt{CGAL\_Qt4}     & \texttt{WITH\_CGAL\_Qt4}     & \ccc{CGAL::GraphicsView} used by the Qt4-based demos                  & Qt4 and OpenGL\\\hline
    \texttt{CGAL\_ImageIO} & \texttt{WITH\_CGAL\_ImageIO} & Utilities to read and write image files in various formats            & OpenGL, ZLib, and VTK (optional)\\\hline
    \texttt{CGAL\_PDB}     & \texttt{WITH\_CGAL\_PDB}     & \ccc{CGAL::PDB} used to manipulate \texttt{PDB} files                 & {\em none}\\\hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\footnotetext[15]{CGAL-core++ is not part of \cgal, it is a custom version the CORE library distributed 
by \cgal\ for the user convenience and it has it's own license.}\addtocounter{footnote}{1}

If you turn off the configuration of a library you can still configure it manually from the  source directory:

{\ccTexHtml{\scriptsize}{}
\begin{verbatim}
  cd CGAL-3.4/src/CGALQt4 
  cmake . # configures only the CGAL_Qt4 library
\end{verbatim}
}

\subsection{Examples and Demos}

\cgal\ is distributed with a large collection of examples and demos. By default, these are NOT configured along with
the \cgal\ libraries unless you set the variables {\tt WITH\_examples=ON} and/or {\tt WITH\_demo=ON}.

Nevertheless, even when configured along with \cgal, they are not automatically built along with the libraries.
To do that you must explicitly build the \texttt{examples} or \texttt{demo} make targets (or IDE projects).

\subsection{Debug vs.\ Release}

The \cmake\ variable \texttt{CMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE} can take the values \texttt{Release} or \texttt{Debug} to indicate how to build
the libraries. The default depends on the platform so it is recommended that you always indicate the build type explicitly.

This is not an issue for solution/project files, as there the user selects the build type from within the IDE.

\subsection{Static vs.\ Dynamic Libraries }

Under Windows we only support  the static versions of the \cgal\ libraries, but on the other platforms
they are by default shared libraries ({\tt .so}).
You can choose to produce static libraries instead by setting the \cmake\ variable {\tt CMAKE\_SHARED\_LIBS=FALSE} 

These setting affect the variants of third-party libraries selected whenever the choice is available.

\subsection{Multiple Variants of makefiles}\label{sec:cmake-out-of-source}

While you can choose between release/debug builds, shared/static libraries,
it is not possible to generate different variants during a single configuration. To do that you need to run \cmake\ in a 
different directory for each variant, each with its own selection of configuration parameters.

\cmake\ stores the resulting makefiles/projectfiles, along with several temporary and auxiliary files such
as the variables cache, in the directory where it is executed, called \texttt{CMAKE\_BINARY\_DIR}, but it
takes the source files and configuration scripts from whatever directory is indicated, called
\texttt{CMAKE\_SOURCE\_DIR} 

The binary and source directories need not be the same, thus, you can configure multiple variants by creating a
distinct directory for each configuration and by running \cmake\ from there. This is known in \cmake\ terminology
as  {\em out-of-source configuration}, as opposite to an {\em in-source configuration} as showed in the 
previous sections.

You can for example generate subdirectories \cgaldir{}\texttt{/cmake/platforms/debug} and 
\cgaldir{}\texttt{/cmake/platforms/release} for two configurations:

{\ccTexHtml{\scriptsize}{}
\begin{verbatim}
mkdir CGAL-3.4/cmake/platforms/debug
cd CGAL-3.4/cmake/platforms/debug
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../../..

mkdir CGAL-3.4/cmake/platforms/release
cd CGAL-3.4/cmake/platforms/release
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../../..
\end{verbatim}
}

\section{Building \cgal\ Libraries}

If configuration succeeded there will be certain {\em build files} ready to build the libraries.
The nature of the build files depend on the generator used during configuration, but in all cases they 
will contain several {\em targets}, one per library,  and a default global target corresponding 
to all the libraries at once.

For example, in a UNIX-like environment the default generator produces makefiles and you would
use the \texttt{make} command-line tool as follow:

{\ccTexHtml{\scriptsize}{}
\begin{verbatim}

cd CGAL-3.4

# build all the selected libraries at once

make 


# build just the libraries needed for the Surface mesher demo

make  CGAL  CGAL_ImageIO CGAL_Qt4

\end{verbatim}
}

The libraries will all be located in a subdirectory {\tt /lib} under {\tt <CMAKE\_BINARY\_DIR>}
which is \cgaldir\ in case you run an in-source-configuration.

With generators other than {\tt UNIX Makefiles} the resulting build files are solution/project files which
should be launched in an {\sc Ide}, such as Visual Studio or KDevelop3. They will contain the targets described
above which you can manually build as any other solution/project within your {\sc Ide}.

Alternatively, you can build it with the command line version of the {\sc Ide}:

{\ccTexHtml{\scriptsize}{}
\begin{verbatim}

    devenv CGAL.sln /Build Debug

\end{verbatim}
}

The "Debug" argument is needed because \cmake\ creates solution files with
all four configurations and you need to explicitly choose one when building
(the other choices are Release, RelWithDebInfo and MinSizeRel).


\begin{ccAdvanced}
The build files produced by \cmake\ are autoconfigured. That is, if you change any 
of the dependencies, the build step automatically goes all the way back to the configure step
during the building. This way, once the target has been configured the very first time by
invoking cmake, you don't necessarily need to invoke \texttt{cmake} again. Rebuilding will call
itself \texttt{cmake} and re-generate the build file whenever needed. Keep this in mind if you
configure \cgal\ for the Visual Studio IDE since a build could then change the solution/project 
file in-place and VS will prompt you to reload it.
\end{ccAdvanced}


If you have turned on the configuration of examples and/or demos, there will be additional
targets named \texttt{examples} and \texttt{demo}, plus one target for each example and each demo.
None of these targets are included in the default so you need to build them explicitly
{\em after} the \cgal\ libraries have been successfully compiled and linked
The targets \texttt{examples} and \texttt{demo} include themselves all the targets
for examples and demos respectively.

{\ccTexHtml{\scriptsize}{}
\begin{verbatim}

# build all examples at once
make examples 

# build only the Straight Skeleton demo
make Straight_skeleton_2_demo

\end{verbatim}
}

\begin{ccAdvanced}
When using \texttt{UNIX Makefiles} you can find out the exact name of the example or demo target
of a particular package typing \texttt{make help | grep <package>}.
\end{ccAdvanced}

\section{Installing \cgal\ Libraries}

% prevent links to /usr/include and /usr/lib (\path commands)
\ccHtmlLinksOff%
On many platforms, library pieces such as headers, docs and binaries
are expected to be placed in specific locations. The typical example
being \path'/usr/include' or \path'/usr/lib' on {\sc Unix}-like
operating systems or \path'C:/Program Files/' on Windows. The process
of placing or copying the library elements into its standard location
is sometimes referred to as {\em Installation} and it is a
postprocessing step after configuration and compilation.
\ccHtmlLinksOn%

\cmake\ supports installation by producing a build target named {\em install}. 
The following example shows a typical session from configuration to
installation in a {\sc Unix}-like environment:

{\ccTexHtml{\scriptsize}{}
\begin{verbatim}

cd CGAL-3.4

cmake .      # configure
make         # compile
make install # install

\end{verbatim}
}

If you used a generator which produced IDE files (for Visual Studio for instance) there will be an optional
\texttt{INSTALL} project which you can {\em ``build''} to execute the installation step. 

\begin{ccAdvanced}

The files are copied into a directory tree relative to the {\em installation directory} determined by the 
\cmake\ variable \texttt{CMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX}. This variable defaults to {\tt /usr/local} under UNIX-like operating systems
and {\tt PROGRAMFILES } under Windows. If you want to install to a different location you must override that cmake
variable explicitly {\em at configuration time} (not when executing the install step).

\end{ccAdvanced}


\section{Configuring and Building Programs Using \cgal}

\cmake\ can be used to configure and build user programs as well via a \cmake\ 
script ({\tt CMakeLists.txt}) for the program.  All the examples and
demos contain such \cmake\ scripts.

During configuration of the \cgal\ libraries a file named {\tt
CGALConfig.cmake} will be generated in the binary directory. This file
contains the definitions of several \cmake\ variable which summarize the
configuration of \cgal. In order to configure a user program you need
to indicate the location of that config file in the \cmake\ variable
\texttt{CGAL\_DIR}:

{\ccTexHtml{\scriptsize}{}
\begin{verbatim}

cd CGAL-3.4/examples/Straight_skeleton_2
cmake -DCGAL_DIR=$HOME/CGAL-3.4 .
make

\end{verbatim}
}

\texttt{CGAL\_DIR} can also be an environment variable.

\subsection{Custom flags in the programs using \cgal}

Normally, programs linked to \cgal\ must use the same flags used by the \cgal\
libraries to avoid runtime problems. For this reason, the {\em very first} time
a program is configured, all the flags given by the \cmake\ variables \texttt{CMAKE\_*\_FLAGS}
are {\em locked} in the sense that the values recorded in \texttt{CGALConfig.cmake} 
are used to override any values given by \cmake\ itself or yourself.

This does not apply to the additional flags that can be given via \texttt{CGAL\_*\_FLAGS}.

Such {\em inherited} values are then recorded on the current \cmake\ cache for the program.
The flags are then {\em unlocked} in the sense that at any subsequent configuration you can
provide you own flags and this time they won't be overridden.

When using the interactive \texttt{cmake-gui}, the first press on \texttt{Configure} unlocks
the flags so you can edit them as needed. 

\begin{ccAdvanced}
The locking of flags is controlled by the variable {\tt CGAL\_DONT\_OVERRIDE\_CMAKE\_FLAGS}
which starts out FALSE and is toggled right after the flags have been loaded from
\texttt{CGALConfig.cmake}.

If you use the command line tool you can specify flags {\em directly} by setting the
controlling variable right up front:

{\ccTexHtml{\scriptsize}{}
\begin{verbatim}

cd CGAL-3.4

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-g .

cd CGAL-3.4/examples/Straight_skeleton_2

cmake -DCGAL_DIR=CGAL-3.4 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-O2 -DCGAL_DONT_OVERRIDE_CMAKE_FLAGS=TRUE . 

\end{verbatim}
}
\end{ccAdvanced}






\section{Summary of Configuration Variables}

Most configuration variables are not environment variables but {\em \cmake\ variables}. They are given in the command line call to \cmake\ via the \texttt{-D} option, 
or using the interactive \texttt{cmake-gui}. Unless explicitly indicated, all the variables summarized below are \cmake\ variables.

\index{cgal!cmake-vars-components}\index{cgal configuration variables - components }
\subsection{Component selection}

The following boolean variables indicate which \cgal\ components to configure and build. Their values can be ON or OFF.

\subsection{Compiler and Linker Flags}

The following variables specify compiler and linker flags. Each variable holds a 
space-separated list of command-line switches for the compiler and linker and 
their default values are automatically defined by \cmake\ based on the target platform.

Have in mind that these variables specify a list of flags, not just one single flag, 
and if you provide your own definition for a variable you will {\em entirely} override
the list of flags chosen by \cmake\ on that particular variable.

The variables that correspond to both debug and release builds are always
used in conjunction with those for the specific build type.

\subsection{Variables providing information about 3rd-party libraries}

The following variables provide information about the availability and location
of the 3rd party libraries used by \cgal. \cmake\ automatically searches 
for dependencies so you only need to specify these variables if they are given a value 
ending in \texttt{NOTFOUND} (which indicates that \cmake\ was unable to locate something)

Since 3rd-party libraries are system wide many of the \cmake\ variables listed below can alternatively
be given as similarly-named environment variables instead. Keep in mind that you must provide one or the
other but never both.

\index{cgal!general-config-cmake-vars-dep-boost}\index{cgal configuration cmake variables - dependencies - boost}
\subsubsection{Boost libraries}

In most cases, if boost is not automatically found, setting the \texttt{BOOST\_ROOT} 
variable is enough. If it is not, you can specify the headers and libraries
directories individually. You can also provide the full pathname to a specific compiled library
if it cannot be found in the libs directory or its name is non-standard.

\subsubsection{GMP and MPFR libraries}

Under Windows, auto-linking is used, so only the {\em directory} 
containing the libs is needed and you would specify \texttt{GMP|MPFR\_LIBRARY\_DIR} rather than
\texttt{GMP|MPFR\_LIBRARIES}. On the other hand, under Linux the actual library filename is needed 
thus you would specify \texttt{GMP|MPFR\_LIBRARIES}. In no case you need to specify both.

\cgal\ uses both gmp and mpfr so both need to be supported. If either of them is unavailable the 
usage of gmp-mpfr will be disabled.

When the LEDA libraries are not automatically found, yet they are installed in the system
with base names 'leda' and 'ledaD' (for the release and debug versions resp.), it might 
be sufficient to just indicate the library directory via the \texttt{LEDA\_LIBRARY\_DIRS} variable.
If that doesn't work because the names are different, you can provide the full pathnames of each variant
via \texttt{LEDA\_LIBRARY\_RELEASE} and \texttt{LEDA\_LIBRARY\_DEBUG}.

The variables specifying definitions and flags can be left undefined if they are not needed by LEDA.

Many of the libraries implementing BLAS and LAPACK require the F2C library for Fortran-to-C convertion.
If this is needed and not found you might specify the fullpath of the library in the \texttt{F2C\_LIBRARIES}
