# BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms).
# ATLAS provides an optimized version of BLAS and a subset of LAPACK.
# We search for a dynamic ATLAS library.
# Note: the "atlas-devel" RPM installs an hybrid LAPACK/ATLAS library in /usr/lib*/atlas.
# This configuration has been tested on Fedora with the "atlas-devel" RPM (g++).
