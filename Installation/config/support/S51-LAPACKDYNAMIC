# LAPACK is a linear algebra library.
# We search for a dynamic Lapack library that includes Blas.
# This configuration has been tested:
# - on Fedora with the "lapack" RPM (g++ and icpc),
# - on Fedora with the "atlas-devel" RPM (g++).
# Note: the "atlas-devel" RPM installs an hybrid LAPACK/Atlas library in /usr/lib*/atlas.
