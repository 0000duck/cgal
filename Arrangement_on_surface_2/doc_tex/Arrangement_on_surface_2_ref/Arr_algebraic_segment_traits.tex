\ccDefinition
%============

The traits class \ccRefName\ is a model of the \ccc{ArrangementTraits_2}
concept that handles planar algebraic curves of arbitrary degree, 
and $x$-monotone of such curves.
A planar (real) \emph{algebraic curve} 
is the vanishing set of a polynomial in two variables, that is, the
curve is defined by the defining equation
$$f(x):=\sum_{i+j\leq n} a_{ij} x^i y^j =0,$$
where $n$ is the degree of the curve.

The traits class allows the construction of algebraic curves,
by specifying their implicit equation. $x$-monotone and vertical segments 
of a curve can also be defined; unbounded curves and segments are supported. 
The template parameter \ccc{Coefficient} defines
the innermost coefficient type of the polynomials. Currently, 
the types \ccc{leda::integer} and \ccc{CORE::BigInt} are supported as well
as any instance of \ccc{CGAL::Sqrt_extension} that is instantiated with
one of the integral types above.

\subsection*{Class
         Arr\_algebraic\_segment\_traits\_2$<$Coefficient$>$::Curve\_2}
%========================================================================

Models the \ccc{ArrangementTraits_2::Curve_2} concept. 
Represents algebraic curves. Internally, the type stores
topological-geometric information about the particular curve.
In order to use internal caching, instances should only be created
using the \ccc{Construct_curve_2} functor of the traits class.

\begin{ccClass}{Arr_algebraic_segment_traits_2<Coefficient>::Curve_2}
%======================================================================

\ccCreationVariable{C}

\ccMethod{Polynomial_2 polynomial () const;}
  {returns the defining polynomial of the curve.}

\end{ccClass}


\subsection*{Class
         Arr\_algebraic\_segment\_traits\_2$<$Coefficient$>$::Point\_2}
%========================================================================

Models the \ccc{ArrangementBasicTraits_2::Point_2} concept.
Represents points in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Intersection points of algebraic curves
are in general non-rational, so we need a data structure that is capable
of representing arbitrary points with algebraic coordinates.

The traits class represents algebraic coordinates by the type
\ccc{Algebraic_real_1}, which is a model of the \ccc{AlgebraicReal_1}
concept.
A point $p$ is stored by a triple $(x,cv,arcno)$, 
where $x$ is the $x$-coordinate of a point, $cv$ is an instance 
of \ccc{Curve_2} that contains the point, (and has no vertical line at $x$),
and $arcno$ is an \ccc{int}, denoting that $p$ is met as the $arcno$-th
point when shooting a vertical ray at $x$, starting from $-\infty$
(where counting starts with $0$). 

In addition to the methods listed below, the copy constructor and assignment
operator for \ccc{Point_2} objects are also supported.

The functor \ccc{Construct_point_2} constructs \ccc{Point_2} instances.

\begin{ccClass}{Arr_algebraic_segment_traits_2<Coefficient>::Point_2}
%======================================================================

\ccCreationVariable{p}

\ccMethod{Algebraic_real_1 x () const;}
  {returns the $x$-coordinate of \ccVar.}

\ccMethod{Algebraic_real_1 y () const;}
  {returns the $y$-coordinates of \ccVar. \\
   \textbf{Attention:} As described above, points are not stored
   by their $y$-coordinate in \ccc{Algebraic_real_1} representation. In fact,
   this representation must be computed on demand, and might become quite
   costly for points defined by high-degree polynomials. Therefore, it is
   recommended to avoid to call this function as much as possible.}

\ccMethod{Curve_2 curve () const;}
  {returns a \ccc{Curve_2} instance that \ccVar is part of.}

\ccMethod{int arcno () const;}
  {returns the arc number of \ccVar.}

\ccMethod{std::pair<double,double> to_double () const;}
  {returns double-approximations of the $x$- and $y$-coordinates.}

\end{ccClass}


\subsection*{Class 
Arr\_algebraic\_segment\_traits\_2$<$Coefficient$>$::X\_monotone\_curve\_2}
%==============================================================================

Models the \ccc{ArrangementBasicTraits_2::X\_monotone\_curve\_2} concept.
Represents terminal segments of an algebraic curves,
that means vertical segments or $x$-monotone segments with no critical
$x$-coordinate in the interior of their $x$-range.
Terminal segments might either be bounded or unbounded.
By definition, each interior point of 
a non-vertical segment has the same arc number (see the documentation of 
type \ccc{Point_2} above, which is called the \emph{arc number} of the segment
(note the the arc number at the endpoints might differ).
Such segments are represented internally by a 4-tuple $(p,q,cv,arcno)$,
where $p$ and $q$ are the endpoints, $cv$ is the \emph{supporting curve}
that the segment belongs to, and arcno is the arc number of the segment.

Arbitrary (weakly) $x$-monotone segments are presented by a range 
of \ccc{X_monotone_curve_2} instances, whose union equals the segment.
The functor \ccc{Construct_x_monotone_segment_2} allows their construction.
To construct all (maximal) terminal segments of a curve,
use the \ccc{Make_x_monotone_2} functor supplied by the traits class.

\begin{ccClass}{Arr_algebraic_segment_traits_2<Coefficient>::X_monotone_curve_2}

\ccCreationVariable{s}

\ccMethod{Curve_2 curve () const;}
  {returns the supporting algebraic curve of \ccVar.}

\ccMethod{bool is\_vertical () const;}
  {returns whether \ccVar\ is a vertical segment.}

\ccMethod{bool is\_finite (CGAL::Arr_curve_end ce) const;}
  {returns whether \ccVar\ has a finite endpoint on the left 
    (if \ccc{ce==CGAL::ARR_MIN_END}) or on the right 
    (if \ccc{ce==CGAL::ARR_MAX_END}).}

\ccMethod{Point_2 curve_end (CGAL::Arr_curve_end ce) const;}
  {returns the left or right endpoint of \ccVar for \ccc{ce==CGAL::ARR_MIN_END}
   and \ccc{ce==CGAL::ARR_MAX_END}.
   \ccPrecond(The corresponding curve end is finite)}

\ccMethod{int arcno () const;}
  {returns the arc number of the segment.
   \ccPrecond(The segment is non-vertical)}

\ccMethod{Algebraic_real_1 x () const;}
  {returns the $x$-coordinate of a vertical segment.
   \ccPrecond(The segment is vertical)}

\end{ccClass}

\ccHeading{Object Creation Functors}

Curves, points, and $x$-monotone segments are created by special functors. 
The functors are not default constructible; the only possibility to
obtain them is by the corresponding accessing functions.
