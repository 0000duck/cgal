\PkgDesc{This package provides three free functions implemented based on the sweep-line paradigm: given a collection of input curves, compute all intersection points, compute the set of subcurves that are pairwise interior-disjoint induced by them, and check whether there is at least one pair of curves among them that intersect in their interior.}

\PkgDescriptionEnd

This chapter describes three functions implemented using the
sweep-line algorithm: given a collection \f$ {\mathcal C}\f$ of 
planar curves, compute all intersection points among them,
obtain the set of maximal pairwise interior-disjoint subcurves
of the curves in \f$ {\mathcal C}\f$, or check whether there is at
least one pair of curves in \f$ {\mathcal C}\f$ that intersect in
their interior.

The first two operations are performed in an output-sensitive
manner.
