- Documentation
  - Ron suggests to keep the "2D Arrangements" (which is long enough as it
    is, but maybe it should be renamed to "2D Planar Arrangements"), and have
    another chapter on "2D Arrangements on General Surfaces".
    This chapter can be much shorter, as all you can do with arrangements was
    explained and demonstrated in the "2D Arrangements" chapter. We should
    however intorduce the concept of TopologyTraits, and re-interpret the
    functionality of the GeometryTraits.

- Add CGAL_ to all defines to protect against collision 

- Add the do_intersect and zone functions.

- Change the interface of all insert_* to be insert.

- Change the interface of Envelope_2 (and Envelope_3):
  to lower_envelope_2 and upper_envelope_2 (lower_envelope_3 and
  upper_envelope_3) and remove lower_envelope_x_monotone_2 and
  upper_envelope_x_monotone_2 (lower_envelope_xy_monotone_3 and
  upper_envelope_xy_monotone_3).
  We can use the value-type of the input iterator to determine which
  operation to perform (just like we do now in insert() ).

- Spherical arcs
  - Test the new vertical-decomposition helper for spherical arcs.

  - The insertion helper and the batched point-location helper seem to have
    been copied from the planar helpers with minor changes. That is, I
    expect to face problem while aggregately inserting new curves into a
    non-empty arrangement on a sphere, or while running a batched
    point-location query on such an arrangement.
    So, there is some work here ... (not much though; these visitors are far
    less complicated than the construction visitor).

  - The "planar" zone visitor is also used here. I believe this should work,
    as it is generic enough (I hope).
    Can you test it by trying to incrementally insert curves to an
    arrrangement on a sphere.

  - We can think of adding a test for the spherical topology, similar to the
    construction test developed by Baruch: Namely read n curves from a file,
   construct their arrangement incrementally; construct it aggregately;
   construct an arrangement of n/2 curves then add the rest of the curves;
   construct two arrangement of n/2 curves each and overlay them. In all
   cases, the arrangement dimensions (V, E, F) must be the same ...
