# Purpose: Figure out TAUCS OSTYPE and print it
# ============================================================================

# In most cases it is set automatically before
# the user's shell begins, but sometimes it is
# not set or set in a way that is inconsistent
# with our usage.

# On SGI IRIX systems, OSTYPE is not set
# (at least in Tel-Aviv University)

if [ \( ${OSTYPE:-fail} = "fail" \) -a \( `uname` = "IRIX64" \) ] ; then
  OSTYPE=irix
fi

# On Linux OSTYPE is usually set to "linux",
# but if it is not set (or if the user unsets it),
# /bin/sh supplies its own politically-correct,
# string, which we need to normalize.

if [ ${OSTYPE:-fail} = "linux-gnu" ] ; then
  OSTYPE=linux
fi

# If OSTYPE is still not set, we try to set it
# from uname, folding to lower case. This should sometimes
# work, but sometimes uname returns a value that is
# inconsistent with the way OSTYPE is set. For example, on
# Solaris, OSTYPE=solaris but uname returns SunOS.

if [ ${OSTYPE:-fail} = "fail" ] ; then
  OSTYPE=`uname | tr "A-Z" "a-z"`
fi

# Print result

if [ ${OSTYPE:-fail} = "fail" ] ; then
  echo ""
else
  echo $OSTYPE
fi
