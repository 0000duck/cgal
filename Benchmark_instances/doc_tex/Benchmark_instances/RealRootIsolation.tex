\section{Real Root Isolation\label{bi_sec:RealRootIsolation}}

The isolation of real roots is a fundamental technique in computer algebra.
In computational geometry it is also used as basic ingredient. 

\subsection{Univariate Case\label{bi_ssec:univariateisolation}}

Univariate polynomials of degree $d$ can have up to $d$ roots. The task
of the real root isolation is to find isolating intervals, such that each
interval contains exactly one of these roots. The following set
contains such univariate polynomials.

The sorting of these roots can be seen as another task.

\subsection{Bivariate Case\label{bi_ssec:bivariateisolation}}

In the bivariate case, one aims to find isolating boxes for value-pairs
where pairs of polynomials vanish. The following file contains
a selection of such polynomials.
