\section{Surface\label{bi_sec:Surface}}

The data sets for surfaces consists of families of quadrics.

\subsection{Quadrics\label{bi_ssec:Quadrics}}

In non-linear computation geometry quadrics are the first non-trivial
curved objects. For various kind of benchmarks, like intersection
curve analyses, arrangement, or lower envelope computation we give
three different kinds of families of quadrics: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Random arbitrary quadrics\\
\ccBenchmarkInstance{data/Surface/Quadrics/random/Quadrics/*.bff}
\item Random ellipsoids
\ccBenchmarkInstance{data/Surface/Quadrics/random/Ellipsoids/*.bff}
\item Random non-ellipsoids
\ccBenchmarkInstance{data/Surface/Quadrics/random/Non-Ellipsoids/*.bff}
\end{itemize}

Each family consists of instances of different numbers of quadrics. The
coefficients of each quadrics are 10-bit integers.
