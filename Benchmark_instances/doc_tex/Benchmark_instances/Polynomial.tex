\section{Polynomial Data}

Polynonomials form fundamenatal mathematical objects, especially
in algebraic computation geometry. Several algorithms need to be implemented
when defining curves and surfaces as zero sets of polynomials. Several
problems can also be reduced to the univariate case, i.e., using elimination
theory. As problems real root isolation, or gcd computations can be
analysed using these data sets.

\subsection{Resultants}

The following instances collect univariate polynomials
of different size (number of polynomials, bitsize) that appear
when computing intersections of quadrics using resultants.

\subsection{Pairs of Bivariate Polynomials}

Concerning bivariate polynomials we list instances of various pairs.
\begin{itemize}
