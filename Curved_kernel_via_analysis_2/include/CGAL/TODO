// TODO put all functionality into functors and make the other private
   members static and functors friend

- Missing functor: Is_in_x_range

- Correctness of Is_bounded (also for torus?)

- Correctness of same_arc_compare_xy (also for QdX-case)

==============================================================================
// TODO Adaptions for QdX

- sheet-numbers after split/trim etc ...

- Construct_point_2 does not take surface as input, as ref surface is given

- TODO: remove mult in Intersect for QdX as it might does not make sense?


==============================================================================
// TODO Tuning

* Re-Introduce caches (not with "int")
