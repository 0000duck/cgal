\begin{ccRefFunction}{Polyline_simplification_2::mark_vertices_unremovable}

\ccDefinition

The function \ccRefName{} marks vertices of a polyline constrained triangulation
so that they will not get removed, i.e. sets their \ccStyle{fixed} member to \ccStyle{true}.

{
Marks the vertices of each polyline constraint with smallest and largest \ccc{x} and \ccc{y} 
coordinates, as well as endpoints and intersections of polylines as unremovable.
