\PkgDesc{All classes in the \cgal kernel provide input and output operators for IO streams.   The basic task of such an operator is to produce a representation of an object that can be written as a sequence of characters on devices as a console, a file, or a pipe. In \cgal we distinguish between  a raw ascii, a raw binary and a pretty printing format.}

\PkgDescriptionEnd
