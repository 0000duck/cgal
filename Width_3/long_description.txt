The width of a three dimensional point set is defined as the minimum
distance between two parallel planes of support of the point set. The
convex hull is computed to simplify the search for such two
planes. Note that these width-planes are not unique; there might exist more
than one pair of parallel supporting planes, all having the same
distance.

For the convex hull computation the three dimensional convex hull
algorithm of CGAL itself have been used. But this calculation requires
LEDA, so LEDA is required for the width computation of a set of points
too. But if the convex hull has been determined elsewhere and if this
hull is represented by an halfedge data structure then the width can
be computed without any use of LEDA. But the STL has been used instead
for some data structures.
