\ccPkgSummary{
A halfedge data structure is an edge-centered data structure
capable of maintaining incidence information of vertices, edges and
faces, for example for planar maps, polyhedra, or other orientable,
two-dimensional surfaces embedded in arbitrary dimension. Each edge is
decomposed into two halfedges with opposite orientations
and each cycle of connected halfedges is associated with a single object 
named \ccc{ccb} (Connected Component of the Boundary).
One incident vertex is stored in each halfedge and one incident halfedge
is stored in each vertex.
Incidence information between halfedges and faces can be stored via
two mutually exclusive mechanisms: storing a handle to a common ccb object
in both faces and halfedges, or directly storing an incident halfedge 
in a face and vice versa.
Reduced variants of the halfedge data structure can omit some of these
information, for example the halfedge pointers in faces or the
storage of faces at all.
