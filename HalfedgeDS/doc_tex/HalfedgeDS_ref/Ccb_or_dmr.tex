The current design supports two {\em mutually exclusive} methods for 
storing the incidence relationship between faces and halfedge cycles:
{\em direct mutual reference}, that is, having faces and halfedges reference 
each other directly, or {\em through a common ccb (Connected Components of the Boundary) item}.
