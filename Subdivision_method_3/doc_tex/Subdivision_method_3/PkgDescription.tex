\ccPkgSummary{ 
Subdivision methods recursively refine a control mesh and generate
points approximating the limit surface.  This package consists of four
popular subdivision methods and their refinement hosts. Supported
subdivision methods include Catmull-Clark, Loop, Doo-Sabin and sqrt(3)
subdivisions. Their respective refinement hosts are {\sc Pqq}, {\sc
Ptq}, {\sc Dqq} and sqrt(3) refinements. Variations of those methods
can be easily extended by substituting the geometry computation of the
refinement host.}
