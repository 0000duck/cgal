\PkgDescriptionEnd

Subdivision methods recursively refine the control mesh 
(i.e. the input mesh) and generate points approximating 
the limit surface. 
Designed to work on the class `Polyhedron_3`,
`Subdivision_method_3` aims to be easy to use and to extend.
`Subdivision_method_3` is not a class, but a namespace 
which consists of four popular subdivision methods and their refinement
hosts. Supported subdivision methods include Catmull-Clark, Loop, 
Doo-Sabin and \f$ \sqrt{3}\f$ subdivisions. Their respective refinement 
hosts are PQQ, PTQ, DQQ and \f$ \sqrt{3}\f$ refinements.
Variations of those methods can be easily 
extended by substituting the geometry computation of the refinement
host.
