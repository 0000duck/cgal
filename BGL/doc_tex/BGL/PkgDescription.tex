\ccPkgSummary{This package provides a framework for interfacing \cgal\
data structures with the algorithms of the {\sc BGL}. It allows to run
graph algorithms directly on \cgal\ data structures which are
model of the {\sc BGL} graph concepts.  
Furthermore, it introduces a
new graph concept, the \ccc{HalfedgeEdgeGraph}. This concept describes
graphs which are embedded on surfaces.}
