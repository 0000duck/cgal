\ccDefinition

The concept \ccRefName\ describes the requirements and constrians of a \ccc{Boost Graph} commonly found in geometric data structures.

This graph is {\em Geometric} meaning that its vertices embeed geometric points (in any geometric dimension) and its edges are {\em implicitely assumed} to be straight line segments (even if a concrete model embeeds a different type of curve).

This graph is {\em Planar} meaning that it \textit{can} be drawn without crossing edges. The planarity requirement is only topological: there is no requirement that the straight line segments implicitely connecting the vertices do not intersect.

The graph is {\em Connected} meaning that any vertex is connected to any other vertex via some path (a sequence of adjacent vertices).
