\ccDefinition

The class \ccRefName\ is a partial specialization of \ccc{boost::graph_traits}
for the class \ccc{Polyhedron_3}. It provides the types  associated 
to the following
\ccAnchor{http://www.boost.org/libs/graph/doc/graph_concepts.html}
{graph} concepts:\\
\ccAnchor{http://www.boost.org/libs/graph/doc/BidirectionalGraph.html}{BidirectionalGraph}\\
\ccAnchor{http://www.boost.org/libs/graph/doc/AdjacencyGraph.html}{AdjacencyGraph}\\
\ccAnchor{http://www.boost.org/libs/graph/doc/EdgeAndVertexListGraph.html}{EdgeAndVertexListGraph}\\




\ccInclude{CGAL/boost/graph/graph_traits_Polyhedron_3.h}



\ccTypes
  \ccTypedef{typename CGAL::Polyhedron_3::Vertex_handle   vertex_descriptor;}
    {The vertex descriptor.}
  
  \ccTypedef{typename CGAL::Polyhedron_3::Halfedge_handle edge_descriptor;}
    {The edge descriptor.}
  
  \ccNestedType{vertex_iterator;}{An iterator corresponding to \ccc{CGAL::Polyhedron_3::Vertex_iterator},
    with the difference that its value type is a vertex descriptor and not \ccc{CGAL::Polyhedron_3::Vertex}.}{}
  
  \ccNestedType{edge_iterator;}{An iterator corresponding to  \ccc{CGAL::Polyhedron_3::Halfedge_iterator}
    with the difference that its value type is an edge descriptor and not \ccc{CGAL::Polyhedron_3::Halfedge}.}{}
  
  \ccNestedType{in_edge_iterator;}{An edge iterator which only iterates over 
  the incoming edges around a vertex. It corresponds to a
  \ccc{CGAL::Polyhedron_3::Halfedge_around_vertex_circulator}
  with the difference that its value type is an edge descriptor and not \ccc{CGAL::Polyhedron_3::Halfedge}.}{}
  
  \ccNestedType{out_edge_iterator;}{An edge iterator which only iterates over 
  the outgoing halfedges around a vertex. It corresponds to a
  \ccc{CGAL::Polyhedron_3::Halfedge_around_vertex_circulator}
  with the difference that its value type is an edge descriptor and not \ccc{CGAL::Polyhedron_3::Halfedge}.}{}
  
  \ccTypedef{boost::directed_tag directed_category;}{Indicates this is a directed graph.}
  
  \ccTypedef{boost::disallow_parallel_edge_tag edge_parallel_category;}
  {Indicates that this graph does not support multiedges.}
  
  \ccTypedef{boost::bidirectional_graph_tag  traversal_category;}
    {Indicates that this graph is bidirectional.}
    
  \ccTypedef{typename Polyhedron_3::size_type vertices_size_type;}
    {The size tye of the vertex list.}
    
  \ccTypedef{typename Polyhedron_3::size_type edges_size_type;}
    {The size tye of the edge list.}
    
  \ccTypedef{typename Polyhedron_3::size_type degree_size_type;}
    {The size tye of the adjacency list.}

The const specialization, \ccc{boost::graph_traits< CGAL::Polyhedron_3<Traits> const>} 
is also defined, using the constant handles in the polyhedron.
