\PkgDesc{This package provides functions for partitioning polygons in monotone or convex polygons. The algorithms can produce results with the minimal number of polygons, as well as approximations which have no more than four  times the optimal number of convex pieces but they differ in  their runtime complexities.}

\PkgDescriptionEnd

The assertion flags for this package use `PARTITION` in their names
(<I>e.g.</I>, `CGAL_PARTITION_NO_POSTCONDITIONS`).
The precondition checks for the planar polygon partitioning functions
are: counterclockwise ordering of the input vertices and simplicity of the 
polygon these vertices represent.

The postcondition checks are: simplicity, counterclockwise orientation,
and convexity (or \f$ y\f$-monotonicity) of the partition polygons
and validity of the partition (<I>i.e.</I>, the partition polygons are 
nonoverlapping and the union of these polygons is the same as the
original polygon).
