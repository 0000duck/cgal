\section{Introduction}
\label{SurfaceMesher_section_intro}

This package provides a global function
to compute a triangular mesh approximating a surface.

The input surface is only required to be described
 through an oracle able to  tell whether a
given segment, line or ray intersects the surface or not
and to compute an intersection point if any.
This feature makes the package generic enough to be
applied in a wide variety of situations. For instance it can be
used to mesh implicit surfaces described as the zero level set
of some function. It may also be used in the field of medical imaging
to mesh surfaces described as a gray
level set in a three dimensional image.


The meshing algorithm is based on the notion of the restricted
Delaunay triangulation. Basically the algorithm  computes a set of
sample points on the surface and extract an interpolating 
surface mesh  from the three dimensional triangulation of these 
sample points. Points are iteratively added to the sample,
as in a Delaunay refinement process, until some size and shape
criteria on mesh elements are satisfied. 


The size and shape criteria control not only the  behaviour of
the refinement process and condition its termination
but they also condition  the size and shape of elements in the final
mesh. Of course those criteria can be customized to satisfy
the user needs. The \ccc{Surface mesher} package offers
a set of standard criteria that can be scaled through
three numerical values. Also the user can plug in its own 
set of refinement criteria.

There is no restriction on the topology and number of components
of the surface provided that the oracle (or the user)
is able to provide one initial sample point on each connected component.
If the surface is smooth enough and the size criteria
small enough, the algorithm guarantees 
that the output mesh is homeomorphic to the
surface and within a small bounded distance
(Hausdorf or even Frechet distance) from the surface.
The algorithm can also be used for non smooth surfaces
but then there is no guarantee. 




\section{The surface mesher interface}
\label{SurfaceMesher_section_interface}

The meshing process is launched through a call to a global function
whose signature is the following:

\ccGlobalFunction{template <class C2T3,
                            class Oracle,
                            class Criteria,
                            class Tag >
void make_surface_mesh(C2T3& c2t3,
                       Oracle surf,
                       Criteria criteria,
                       Tag = Non_manifold());}

The first template parameter \ccc{C2T3} describes 
the data structure
used to store  the surface mesh. This data structure
has a pointer to a three dimensional triangulation and encodes
the surface mesh as a subset of facets in this triangulation.
The data structure is described in the concept
\ccc{PureComplex_2InTriangulation_3} which is a specialized version
of a more general concept called  \ccc{Complex_2InTriangulation_3}.
More precisely, the concept \ccc{Complex_2InTriangulation_3}
encodes a two dimensional complex embedded  in a three dimensional
triangulation, which means that the faces of the complex form a subset
of the triangulation faces. The concept \ccc{PureComplex_2InTriangulation_3} is 
specialized to the case where the complex is pure which means that it
is a set of facets (i.e., two dimensional faces) with  their subfaces.
An object of this class is passed by reference to the meshing
function. This object holds the output mesh at the end of the
process.

The second parameter \ccc{Oracle} handles the surface
description. This parameter  has to be a model of
the concept \ccc{SurfaceOracle} which describes the
required oracle on the surface. The actual surface to be meshed is
passed  to the global function through an object of the class \ccc{Oracle}.

The third parameter handles the description of the size and shape
criteria driving the meshing process. The parameter \ccc{Criteria}
has to be instantiated by a model of the concept \ccc{MeshCriteria}.


The last parameter is optional, it is a tag 
whose type influences the behavior of the
meshing algorithm, see Section~\ref{SurfaceMesher_section_variations}

A call to 
\ccc{surface_mesher(c2t3,surf,criteria) } launches 
the meshing process with an initial 
set of points which is the union of two subsets:
the set of vertices in the  initial triangulation pointed to by \ccc{c2t3},
and a set of points provided by the \ccc{initial_points()} method 
of the oracle \ccc{surf}. This initial set of points is required 
to include at least one point on each connected component of the surface
to be meshed.


\section{Example}
\label{SurfaceMesher_section_example}

The following code meshes an implicit surface described as the zero level
set of some function $f : \R^3 \longrightarrow \R$.
The \ccc{SurfaceOracle}  is built from 
a function object
the type \ccc{MyFunction <K::FT>} whose operator()
takes three numerical values \ccc{(x,y,z)} of type \ccc{FT}
and returns a value of type \ccc{FT} which is the function $f(x,y,z)$.

The default meshing criteria are  are determined  by three numerical
values: \\ 
\ccc{angular_bound} is a lower bound in degrees for the angles 
     of mesh facets.\\
\ccc{radius_bound} is an upper bound on the radii of surface Delaunay
balls. A surface Delaunay ball is ball circumscribing a mesh facet
and centered on the surface. \\
\ccc{distance_bound} is an upper bound for the distance 
between the circumcenter of a mesh facet and a surface
Delaunay ball of the same facet.

\section{Meshing criteria, guarantees and variations}
\label{SurfaceMesher_section_criteria}
\label{SurfaceMesher_section_variations}

The guarantees on the output mesh depend on the mesh criteria.
Theoretical guarantees are given in \cite{Oudot-and-co}.
First, the meshing algorithm is proved to terminate 
if the angular bound is
not smaller than $20,7^0$. 
Furthermore, if the radius bound is everywhere smaller than 
the $\epsilon$ times the local feature size  (where $\epsilon$ is a constant
less than 0.16),  the output mesh 
is guaranteed to be homeomorphic to the surface
and at a bounded distance (Hausdorff and even Frechet distance)
from the mesh.
Note that the radius bound need not be uniform,
although it is a uniform bound in the default criteria.

Of course, such a theoretical guarantee can be only achieved
for smooth surfaces which have a finite, non zero
reach value. (The reach of a surface is the minimum value of local feature size on
this surface).

The value of the local feature size on any point of the surface
or its minimum on the surface it usually not known
although it can sometimes be guessed. Also it happens frequently
that setting the meshing criteria so as to fulfill the theoretical
conditions yield an over refined mesh.
On the other hand, when the size criteria are relaxed,
no homeomorphism with the input surface is guaranteed
and the output mesh is not even guaranteed to be manifold.
To remedy this problem and give a more flexible
meshing algorithm, the global function 
\ccc{make_surface_mesh} has a tag template parameter
allowing to slightly change the behavior of the refinement process.
This feature allows for instance to run the meshing
algorithm with a relaxed size criteria, more coherent
with the size of the mesh expected by the user,
and still have a guarantee that
the output mesh forms a manifold surface.
The function \ccc{make_surface_mesh} has specialized versions
for the following  tag types: \\
\ccc{Manifold_tag}: the output mesh is guaranteed to be a manifold
surface without boundary.\\
\ccc{Manifold_with_boundary_tag}:the output mesh is guaranteed to be
manifold but may have boundaries.\\
\ccc{Non_manifold_tag}: the algorithm relies on the given criteria and
guarantees nothing else.

\section{Implementation}

The meshing algorithm is implemented using the design of mesher levels
described in \cite{Rineau-and-co}.
