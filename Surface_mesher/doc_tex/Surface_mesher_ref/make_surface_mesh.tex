\ccDefinition
  
The function \ccRefName\ is a surface mesher,
that is a function to build a two dimensional mesh 
approximating  a surface.

The library provides two overloaded version 
of this function~:



\ccGlobalFunction{template <class C2T3,
                            class Surface,
                            class Criteria,
                            class Tag >
void make_surface_mesh(C2T3& c2t3,
                       Surface surface,
                       Criteria criteria,
                       Tag ) ;}


\ccGlobalFunction{template <class C2T3,
                            class SurfaceMeshTraits,
                            class Criteria,
                            class Tag >
void make_surface_mesh(C2T3& c2t3,
                       SurfaceMeshTraits::Surface_3  surface,
		       SurfaceMeshTraits traits,
                       Criteria criteria,
                       Tag );}



\ccParameters
The template parameter  \ccc{C2T3}
is required to be a model of the concept
\ccc{SurfaceMeshComplex_2InTriangulation_3},
a data structure able to represent a two dimensional
complex  embedded in a three dimensional triangulation.
The argument \ccc{c2t3} of type \ccc{C2T3},  passed by reference
to the surface mesher, 
is used to maintain  the current approximating mesh and it stores
the final mesh at the end of the procedure.
The type \ccc{C2T3} is in particuler required to
provide a type \ccc{C2T3::Triangulation_3}
for the three dimensional triangulation
embedding the surface mesh.
The vertex and cell base classes of the triangulation
\ccc{C2T3::Triangulation_3} are required
to be  models  of the concepts 
\ccc{SurfaceMeshVertexBase_3} and 
\ccc{SurfaceMeshCellBase_3} respectively.


The required knowledge on the surface is encapsulated in
a surface mesher traits class  which is the only way the mesher
 accesses to the surface. This traits class is required to be a model
of the concept \ccc{SurfaceMeshTraits_3}. \\
In the first  version
of  \ccRefName\, the surface type is a template paramater \ccc{Surface}
and the surface mesher traits type 
is  automatically generated form the surface type  through
the class 
\ccc{Surface_mesh_traits_generator_3<Surface>}.
(This mecanism is similar to the 
\ccc{Kernel_traits}  mecanism.) \\
In the second version, the surface mesher traits type is provided
as a template parameter 
and the surface type is deduced from this traits type.
Both the surface and the traits 
are passed to the mesher as parameters. \\
The simpler first version can be used,
whenever the surface type either provides  a nested type
\ccc{Surface::Surface_mesher_traits_3} 
that is  a model of \ccc{SurfaceMeshTraits_3}
or is a surface type for which a specialization
of the traits generator \ccc{Surface_mesh_traits_generator_3<Surface>}
is provided.
Currently, the library provides partial specializations
of  \ccc{Surface_mesher_traits_generator_3<Surface>}
for implicit surfaces (\ccc{Implicit_surface_3<Traits, Func> }) and 
grey level images (\ccc{Gray_level_image_3<Traits> }).
 


The template parameter \ccc{Criteria} has to be a model
of the concept \ccc{SurfaceMeshCriteria}.
The argument of type  \ccc{Criteria} passed to the surface
mesher specifies the size and shape  requirements
on the output surface mesh.

The template parameter \ccc{Tag}
is a tag whose type affects the behaviour of the
meshing algorithm. The function \ccRefName\  has specialized versions
for the following  tag types: \\
- \ccc{Manifold_tag}: the output mesh is guaranteed to be a manifold
surface without boundary.\\
- \ccc{Manifold_with_boundary_tag}: the output mesh is guaranteed to be
manifold but may have boundaries.\\
- \ccc{Non_manifold_tag}: the algorithm relies on the given criteria and
guarantees nothing else.



The Delaunay refinement
process is started with an initial set of points which is the union 
of two sets: the
set of vertices in the initial  triangulation pointed to by the
\ccc{c2t3} argument   and a set of
points output by the \ccc{Construct_initial_points()} 
of the surface.
This initial set of points is required to include at least one point
on each connected components of the surface to be meshed.
