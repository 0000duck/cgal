- Removed cgal_confog.bat

19 February 2007 Fernando Cacciola
- The following .vcproj files have been replaced by *_71.vcproj and *_VC80.vcproj:
    master.vcproj, cgalib.vcproj, CORE.vcproj and CGALQt.vcproj
  (the old project files were removed).
- When built via the new VC project files, CGAL.lib, core++.lib and CGALQt.lib
  are now generated with names indicating the compiler version and configuration,
  in the same way boost libraries are named (for example, cgal-mt-s.lib)
- Folder "wininst/include/CGAL/config/msvc7/CGAL" renamed as "wininst/include/CGAL/config/msvc/CGAL"
- New file "cl_1400.h" (for VC8.0) added into "config/msvc/CGAL". 
- New file "auto_link.h" added into "config/msvc/CGAL". 
- File "compiler_config.h" edited to include "cl_1400.h" in case of VC8, and to
  include "auto_link.h" to enable the new auto link feature (which automatically
  intructs the compiler to link to the correct library based on the current
  compiler and configuration)  
- C2vcproj edited to produced the new _70.vcproj and _80.vcproj versions.
- C2vcproj fixed to add files named "xyz.cpp" as "xyz.cpp" instead of "xyz.C"
  (note: mpfr.lib is no longer in master.vcproj even though the change log for
   29 sep 2004 says it was added)
- C2dsw and C2dsp removed.
- master.dsw and master.dsp removed.   
- File CORE/Config.h edited to include auto_link.h and enable auto-linking
  for the core++ library variants.
- File IO/Qt_widget.h edited to include auto_link.h and enable auto-linking
  for the cgalqt library variants.

- Removed directory lib/msvc7

29 September 2004
- Added mpfr.lib to the file master.vcproj

03 June 2004 Radu Ursu
- updated cgallib.vcproj: removed oprimisation_basic.C 
- this project is also a VC++ 7.1 project, which means that it can't be 
  opened with VC++7.0 which is no longer supported 

21 May 2004 Sylvain Pion
- C2vcproj : pick master.vcproj where it is instead of forcing the release
             scripts to copy it.
