Surface Reconstruction

[TODO: replace next paragraph by actual description]

We propose to elaborate upon a CGAL Package which
implements some of the state-of-the-art surface reconstruction
methods. Priority will be given to methods
which take as input unorganized point sets and which
compute an implicit function, although we leave the room
to Delaunay-based techniques as all building blocks are
available in CGAL. A common implicit function is an
approximate distance function to the input points or to an
estimate tangent plane, or an indicator function.
