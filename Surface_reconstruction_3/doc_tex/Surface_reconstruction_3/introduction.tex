\section{Introduction}

This \cgal\ package implements some
of the state-of-the-art surface reconstruction methods. Priority is
given to methods which take as input unorganized point sets and
which compute an implicit function, although we leave the room to
Delaunay-based techniques as all building blocks are available in
\cgal. A common implicit function is an approximate distance function
to the input points or to an estimate tangent plane, or an indicator
function.

The package proposes an interface to the \cgal\ Surface Mesh Generator~\cite{cgal:ry-gsddrm-06,cgal:bo-pgsms-05},
and we leave the room to other surface contouring techniques such
as the Marching Cubes algorithm~\cite{LC87} and its variants (a
user may prefer using his favorite contouring algorithm).

The input is an unorganized point set, possibly with attributes
such as unoriented normals, oriented normals.

Since reconstruction methods often require to preprocess a point set
(e.g. estimate and orient the normals), we provide components devoted
to this task.

The output can be either an implicit function (ready for evaluation
by any contouring algorithm), or a surface mesh, compatible with the
BGL Graph concept and \cgal\ polyhedron when 2-manifold, or represented
as a polygon soup otherwise.
