\ccPkgSummary{
[TODO: replace next paragraph by actual description]

We propose to elaborate upon a CGAL Package which implements some
of the state-of-the-art surface reconstruction methods. Priority will
be given to methods which take as input unorganized point sets and
which compute an implicit function, although we leave the room to
Delaunay-based techniques as all building blocks are available in
CGAL. A common implicit function is an approximate distance function
to the input points or to an estimate tangent plane, or an indicator
function.
