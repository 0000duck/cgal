\subsection{Precision}

Delaunay-based Poisson reconstruction solves a linear system with TAUCS
linear solver, that uses double precision floating point
numbers.

Algebraic Point Set Surfaces uses a closed form, thus computes exact results, when used with an exact arithmetic.

Anyway, \cgal\ Surface Mesh Generator contours an implicit surface using dichotomy
until the expected error is reached, thus the output surface mesh is never exact.
