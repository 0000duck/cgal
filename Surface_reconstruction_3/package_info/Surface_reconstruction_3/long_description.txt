Surface Reconstruction
Specification for a CGAL package

Pierre Alliez, Laurent Saboret, Gael Guennebaud

This CGAL package implements some of the state-of-the-art surface
reconstruction methods. Priority is given to methods
which take as input unorganized point sets and
which compute an implicit function.

The package proposes an interface to the CGAL Surface Mesh Generator.

The input is an unorganized point set, possibly with attributes
such as unoriented normals, oriented normals.

Since reconstruction methods often require to preprocess a point set
(e.g. estimate and orient the normals), we provide components devoted
to this task.

The output can be either an implicit function (ready for evaluation
by any contouring algorithm), or a surface mesh.
