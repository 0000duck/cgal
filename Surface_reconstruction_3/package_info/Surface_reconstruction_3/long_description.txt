Surface Reconstruction
Specification for a CGAL package

Pierre Alliez, Laurent Saboret, Gael Guennebaud

This CGAL package implements some of the state-of-the-art surface
reconstruction methods. Priority is given to methods which take
as input unorganized point sets and compute an implicit function.

The input is an unorganized point set, possibly with attributes
such as unoriented normals, oriented normals.

Since reconstruction methods often require to preprocess a point set
(reduction, smoothing, outlier removal, normal estimation, normal
orientation), we provide components devoted to these tasks.

The output is either an implicit function (ready for evaluation by
any contouring algorithm), or a surface mesh generated by the
CGAL surface mesh generator.
