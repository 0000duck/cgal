- countless bugfixes
- replaced Antichain::compute_graph, in order to no longer use chi3
- replaced Antichain::glue_ccw_cw, to avoid memory leaks
- thoroughly modified Antichain::sweep and Antichain::compute_phi
- moved most of the stuff into the subnamespace
Visibility_complex_2_details, many renamings.
- added a destructor for Visibility_complex_2
- added class Compute_free_bitangents_2 to ease use of the linear sweep
- added class Shortest_path_2, a nicer interface for the shortest path code
- removed the functions visibility_complex_2 and shortest_path_2
- added an iterator over the border of the faces
- the disks are now copied into the complex, and the constraints are passed
using the class Constraint_input, instead of having to be created
beforehand by the user; added iterators over the disks and constraints
- added methods positive_edge and negative_edge to obtain an edge of a disk
- removed unused and broken features (Scene, Linear_decorator, ...)
- replaced the embryo of a testsuite with a complete one
- updated the documentation.

28 April 2004 Radu Ursu
- modified tex files in doc_tex/Visibility_complex_ref to \ccInclude the right header files in include/CGAL instead of CEP/Visibility_complex.
- added two more examples from the doc 

28 April 2004 Radu Ursu

- changed files according to statement change from CEP to CGAL package

Before 22 April 2004

- CGAL:: missing in shortest_path.C in testsuite and demo
- std::missing for copy and back_inserter
- leftturn is deprecated and replaced by left_turn  (g++ warns about that)
  Shouldn't that be function objects anyway?
- the same for rightturn
- made a Point_2    const Point_2&
