arrangements: computes a greedy pseudotriangulation of points, allowing to
flip minimal bitangents.

(point|segment|polygon|circle)_input: input a scene of disks and
constraints. Takes as argument a file name to store the disks, and an
optional file name to store the constraints. First input the disks (to
complete a polygon, click on the right button), then press enter, then
input the constraints (click the source then the target disk, a left click
will yield a left bitangent, and a right click a right bitangent), then
press enter to complete. The backspace key allows to pop the previously
input disks or constraints.

(point|segment|polygon|circle)_display: displays a scene of disks and
constraints

(point|segment|polygon|circle)_compute_vc: computes the visibility complex
of a scene, and displays the bitangents.

(point|segment|polygon|circle)_compute_vc: computes and displays the
free bitangents of a scene.

(point|segment|polygon)_compute_sp: computes and displays the shortest path
connecting the first two disks of a scene.

The directory ../../examples/Visibility_complex/data contains example
scenes. The .d files contain the disks, the .c contain the constraints. The
*compute_(vc|bit|sp) and *display demos take as first argument the file
containing the disks, and, optionally, as second argument the file
containing the constraints.
