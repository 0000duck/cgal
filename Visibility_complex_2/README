Purpose:
     This package implements the visibility complex data structure for planar
     scenes.

Description:

      This package can be used to compute the visibility graph or visibility
      complex of planar scenes. These scenes can consist in pairwise
      non-intersecting points, segments, circles or polygons.
      The package can also be used to compute the shortest path between two
      points in such scenes.
