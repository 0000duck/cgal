\section Surface_mesh_parameterizationIntroduction Introduction

Parameterizing a surface amounts to finding a one-to-one mapping from
a suitable domain to the surface. A good mapping is the one which
minimizes either angle distortions (conformal parameterization) or
area distortions (equiareal parameterization) in some sense. In this
package, we focus on parameterizing triangulated surfaces which are
homeomorphic to a disk, and on piecewise linear mappings onto a planar
domain.

Although the main motivation behind the first parameterization methods
was the application to texture mapping, it is now frequently used for
mapping more sophisticated modulation signals (such as normal,
transparency, reflection or light modulation maps), fitting scattered
data, re-parameterizing spline surfaces, repairing CAD models,
approximating surfaces and remeshing.

This \cgal package implements
surface parameterization methods, such as As Rigid As Possible Parameterization,
Least Squares Conformal Maps, Discrete Conformal Map, Discrete Authalic
Parameterization, Floater Mean Value Coordinates or Tutte Barycentric
Mapping. These methods mainly distinguish by the distortion they
minimize (angles vs. areas), by the constrained border onto the
planar domain (convex polygon vs. free border) and by the guarantees
provided in terms of bijective mapping.

The package proposes an interface for any model of the concept `FaceGraph`,
such as the classes `Surface_mesh`, `Polyhedron_3`, or the mesh
classes of OpenMesh.

Since parameterizing meshes requires an efficient representation of sparse
matrices and efficient iterative or direct linear solvers, we provide
a unified interface to linear solvers  as described in Chapter
\ref PkgSolverSummary.

Note that linear solvers commonly use double precision floating point
numbers. Therefore, this package is intended to be used with a \cgal %Cartesian kernel with doubles.

\section Surface_mesh_parameterizationBasics Basics

\subsection Surface_mesh_parameterizationDefaultSurface Default Surface Parameterization

From the user point of view, the simplest entry point to this package
is the following function:

\code{.cpp}
template <typename TriangleMesh>
Parameterizer_traits<TriangleMesh>::Error_code
parameterize(TriangleMesh & mesh,
             boost::graph_traits<TriangleMesh>::halfedge_descriptor bhd,
             VertexUVMap uvm);
\endcode

The function `parameterize()` applies a default surface parameterization
method, namely Floater Mean Value Coordinates \cgalCite{cgal:f-mvc-03},
to the connected component of the mesh of type `TriangleMesh` with the border given by the halfedge `bhd`.
This border is parameterized with an arc-length circular border parameterization.
The sparse linear solver of the \ref thirdpartyEigen library is used.

The mesh of type `TriangleMesh` must be a model of the concept
`FaceGraph` and must additionally be triangulated, 2-manifold, oriented,
and homeomorphic to a disc (possibly with holes). The last requirement
is not hard and we will later show how to parameterize a mesh that is
not a topological disk (Section \ref secCuttingaMesh).
The result is stored in a property map (whose type is here VertexUVMap)
for the mesh vertices. See also Chapter \ref PkgProperty_mapSummary.

The class `Parameterizer_traits_3<TriangleMesh>` is a base class of all surface
parameterizations and defines the error codes.

\subsection Surface_mesh_parameterizationDefaultExample Default Parameterization Example
In the following example, we apply the default parameterization to a
`Surface_mesh` mesh. We store the UV-coordinates as a vertex property
using the `Surface_mesh` built-in property mechanism.

\cgalExample{Surface_mesh_parameterization/simple_parameterization.cpp}

\subsection Surface_mesh_parameterizationEnhancedparameterize Choosing a Parameterization Algorithm

This package provides a second `parameterize()` entry point
where the user can specify a parameterization method:

\code{.cpp}
template <typename TriangleMesh>
Parameterizer_traits<TriangleMesh>::Error_code
parameterize(TriangleMesh& mesh,
             ParameterizerTraits_3 parameterizer,
             boost::graph_traits<TriangleMesh>::halfedge_descriptor bhd,
             VertexUVMap uvm);
\endcode

It computes a one-to-one mapping from a 3D triangle surface mesh to a simple 2D domain.
The mapping is piecewise linear on the triangle mesh. The result is a pair (u,v)
of parameter coordinates for each vertex of the input mesh.
A one-to-one mapping may be guaranteed or not, depending on the chosen
ParameterizerTraits_3 algorithm.

In the following example, we use a circular uniform border parameterization
and then use the discrete authalic parameterizer with a
`Surface_mesh`. We store the UV-coordinates as a vertex property
using the `Surface_mesh` built-in property mechanism.

\cgalExample{Surface_mesh_parameterization/discrete_authalic.cpp}

\section secSurfaceParameterizationMethods Surface Parameterization Methods

This \cgal package implements surface parameterization methods, such
as Least Squares Conformal Maps, Discrete Conformal Map, Discrete
Authalic Parameterization, Floater Mean Value Coordinates or Tutte
Barycentric Mapping. These methods are provided as models of the
`ParameterizerTraits_3` concept.

\subsection Surface_mesh_parameterizationFixedBorder Fixed Border Surface Parameterizations

Fixed border surface parameterizations need a set of constraints: two
(u,v) coordinates for each vertex along the border.
Such border parameterizations are described in Section
\ref secBorderParameterizationsforFixedMethods.

\subsubsection Surface_mesh_parameterizationTutteBarycentric Tutte Barycentric Mapping

`Barycentric_mapping_parameterizer_3<TriangleMesh, BorderParameterizer_3, SparseLinearAlgebraTraits_d>`

The Barycentric Mapping parameterization method has been introduced by
Tutte \cgalCite{t-hdg-63}. In parameter space, each vertex is
placed at the barycenter of its neighbors to achieve the so-called
convex combination condition. This algorithm amounts to solve one
sparse linear solver for each set of parameter coordinates, with a
\#vertices x \#vertices sparse and symmetric positive definite matrix
(if the border vertices are eliminated from the linear system).
A coefficient \f$ (i, j)\f$ of the matrix is set to 1 for an edge linking
the vertex \f$ v_i\f$ to the vertex \f$ v_j\f$, to minus the degree of the
vertex \f$ v_i\f$ for a diagonal element, and to 0 for any other matrix
entry. Although a bijective mapping is guaranteed when the border is convex,
this method does not minimize angles nor areas distortion.

\subsubsection Surface_mesh_parameterizationDiscreteConformal Discrete Conformal Map

`Discrete_conformal_map_parameterizer_3<TriangleMesh, BorderParameterizer_3, SparseLinearAlgebraTraits_d>`

Discrete conformal map parameterization has been introduced to the graphics community
by Eck et al. \cgalCite{cgal:eddhls-maam-95}. It attempts to
lower angle deformation by minimizing a discrete version of the
Dirichlet energy as derived by Pinkall and
Polthier \cgalCite{cgal:pp-cdmsc-93}. A one-to-one mapping is guaranteed
only when the two following conditions are fulfilled: the barycentric mapping
condition (each vertex in parameter space is a convex combination if
its neighboring vertices), and the border is convex.
This method solves two \#vertices x \#vertices sparse linear
systems. The matrix (the same for both systems) is sparse and symmetric definite
positive (if the border vertices are eliminated from the linear system
and if the mesh contains no hole),
thus can be efficiently solved using dedicated linear solvers.

\subsubsection Surface_mesh_parameterizationFloaterMean Floater Mean Value Coordinates

`Mean_value_coordinates_parameterizer_3<TriangleMesh, BorderParameterizer_3, SparseLinearAlgebraTraits_d>`

The mean value coordinates parameterization method has been introduced
by Floater \cgalCite{cgal:f-mvc-03}. Each vertex in parameter space is
optimized so as to be a convex combination of its neighboring
vertices. The barycentric coordinates are this time unconditionally
positive, by deriving an application of the mean theorem for harmonic
functions. This method is in essence an approximation of the discrete conformal
maps, with a guaranteed one-to-one mapping when the border is convex.
This method solves two \#vertices x \#vertices sparse linear systems. The matrix (the
same for both systems) is asymmetric.

\subsubsection Surface_mesh_parameterizationDiscreteAuthalic Discrete Authalic Parameterization

`Discrete_authalic_parameterizer_3<TriangleMesh, BorderParameterizer_3, SparseLinearAlgebraTraits_d>`

The discrete authalic parameterization method has been introduced by
Desbrun et al. \cgalCite{cgal:dma-ipsm-02}. It corresponds to
a weak formulation of an area-preserving method, and in essence
locally minimizes the area distortion. A one-to-one mapping is
guaranteed only if the convex combination condition is fulfilled and
the border is convex. This method solves two
\#vertices x \#vertices sparse linear systems. The matrix (the same
for both systems) is asymmetric.

\subsection secBorderParameterizationsforFixedMethods Border Parameterizations for Fixed Methods

Parameterization methods for
borders are used as traits classes modifying the behavior of
`ParameterizerTraits_3` models.
They are provided as models of the `BorderParameterizer_3` concept.
Border parameterizations for fixed border surface parameterizations
are a family of methods to define a set of constraints, namely two
\f$ u,v\f$ coordinates for each vertex along the border.

Different choices are offered to the user when choosing border parameterizers
for fixed border methods:
<UL>
<LI>The user can select a border parameterization among
two commonly used methods: uniform or arc-length parameterization.

<I>Usage:</I> Uniform border parameterizations are more stable,
although they give poor visual results. The arc-length border
parameterization is used by default.

<LI>One convex shape specified by one shape among two standard ones:
a circle or a square.

<I>Usage:</I> The circular border parameterization is used by default as it
corresponds to the simplest convex shape. The square border
parameterization is commonly used for texture mapping.
</UL>

\subsection Surface_mesh_parameterizationFreeBorderSurface Free Border Surface Parameterizations

\subsubsection Surface_mesh_parameterizationLeastSquares Least Squares Conformal Maps

`LSCM_parameterizer_3<TriangleMesh, BorderParameterizer_3, SparseLinearAlgebraTraits_d>`

The Least Squares Conformal Maps (LSCM) parameterization method has
been introduced by L&eacute;vy et al. \cgalCite{cgal:lprm-lscm-02}.
It corresponds to a conformal method with a free border (at least two
vertices have to be constrained to obtain a unique solution), which
allows further lowering of the angle distortion. A one-to-one mapping
is not guaranteed by this method. It solves a (2 \f$ \times\f$
\#triangles) \f$ \times\f$ \#vertices sparse linear system in the least squares sense,
which implies solving a symmetric matrix.

\subsubsection Surface_mesh_parameterizationARAP As Rigid As Possible Parameterization

`ARAP_parameterizer_3<TriangleMesh, BorderParameterizer_3, SparseLinearAlgebraTraits_d>`

An as rigid as possible parameterization was introduced by Liu et al. \cgalCite{liu2008local}.
shape-preserving method based on an iterative energy minimization process.
Each step alternates a local optimization technique to find the best local mapping
and a global stitching technique equivalent to the resolution of a linear system
to guarantee that the parameterized mesh is a triangulation.

A generalization of the formulation of the local optimization introduces a scalar
coefficient &lambda; that allows the user to choose to give importance to angle
preservation (conforming) when &lambda; = 0, to shape preservation (as rigid as
possible) when &lambda; goes to infinity, or a balance of both.

\subsection secBorderParameterizationsforFreeMethods Border Parameterizations for Free Methods

Parameterization methods for
borders are used as traits classes modifying the behavior of
`ParameterizerTraits_3` models. They are provided as models of the `BorderParameterizer_3` concept.
The border parameterizations associated to free border surface
parameterization methods define only two constraints: the pinned vertices.

<UL>

<LI>`Two_vertices_parameterizer_3<TriangleMesh>`

<I>Usage:</I> `Two_vertices_parameterizer_3<TriangleMesh>` is the default
free border parameterization, and is the only one available
in the current version of this package.

</UL>

\section secCuttingaMesh Cutting a Mesh

The surface parameterization methods proposed in this package only
deal with meshes which are homeomorphic (topologically equivalent) to
discs. Nevertheless, meshes with arbitrary topology and number of
connected components can be parameterized, provided that the user
specifies a cut graph (a set of edges), which defines the
border of a topological disc. These edges can be passed together with
a mesh via the `Seam_mesh` structure.

\cgalFigureBegin{Surface_mesh_parameterizationfigcut,cut.png}
Cut Graph
\cgalFigureEnd

In the following example, we apply the default parameterization to a
`Polyhedron_3`-based `Seam_mesh`. We store the UV-coordinates as a
halfedge property using a `Unique_hash_map`.

Note that vertices on a seam are duplicated in a `Seam_mesh` structure
and thus the UV-coordinates are here associated to halfedges of the
seam mesh.

\section Surface_mesh_parameterizationComplexity Complexity and Guarantees

\subsection Surface_mesh_parameterizationParameterization Parameterization Methods and Guarantees

<UL>

<LI>Fixed boundaries

<UL>

<LI>One-to-one mapping

Tutte's theorem guarantees a one-to-one mapping provided that the weights are all positive
and the border convex.
It is the case for Tutte barycentric mapping and Floater mean value coordinates.
It is not always the case for discrete conformal map (cotangents) and
discrete authalic parameterization.

<LI>Non-singularity of the matrix

Geshorgin's theorem guarantees the convergence of the solver if the matrix is diagonal dominant.
This is the case with positive weights (Tutte barycentric mapping and Floater mean value coordinates).

</UL>

<LI>Free boundaries

<UL>

<LI>One-to-one mapping

No guarantee is provided by either LSCM or ARAP parameterizations (both global
overlaps and triangle flips can occur).

<LI>Non-singularity of the matrix

For LSCM, the matrix of the system is the Gram matrix of a matrix with maximal rank,
and is therefore non-singular (Gram theorem).

\section Surface_mesh_parameterizationExtendingthe Implementation History

The main author of the first version of this package was Laurent Saboret,
who worked as an engineer at Inria Sophia-Antipolis.

For CGAL 4.10 the package has undergone a major rewrite by Andreas Fabri.
The algorithms are the same, but they are now based on the `FaceGraph` API.
Additionally, the class `Seam_mesh` got introduced, which is also a model of
a `FaceGraph`, and it replaces a wrapper which had a more complicated API.
