\begin{ccPkgDescription}{Planar Parameterization of Triangulated Surface Meshes}
\ccPkgSummary{Parameterizing a surface amounts to finding a one-to-one mapping from
a suitable domain to the surface. In this package, we focus on
triangulated surfaces that are homeomorphic to a disk and on piecewise
linear mappings into a planar domain.  This \cgal\ package implements
some of the state-of-the-art surface mesh parameterization methods,
such as Least Squares Conformal Maps, Discrete Conformal Map, Discrete
Authalic Parameterization, Floater Mean Value Coordinates or Tutte
Barycentric Mapping.}
