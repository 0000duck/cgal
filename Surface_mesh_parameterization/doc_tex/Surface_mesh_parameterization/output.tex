\section{Output}

Parameterization methods compute $(u,v)$ fields for each vertex
of the input mesh, with the seam vertices being virtually duplicated (thanks
to \ccc{Parameterization_mesh_patch_3<ParameterizationPatchableMesh_3>}).

To support this duplication,
\ccc{Parameterization_polyhedron_adaptor_3<Polyhedron_3_>} stores
the result in the $(u,v)$ fields of the input mesh halfedges.
A $(u,v)$ pair is provided for
each inner vertex (i.e. its halfedges share the same $(u,v)$ pair),
while a $(u,v)$ pair is provided for each seam halfedge.
The user has to iterate over the mesh halfedges to get the result.

Note: $(u,v)$ fields do not exist in CGAL \ccc{Polyhedron_3},
thus the output traversal is specific to the way the (u,v) fields are implemented by the adaptor.

\subsection{EPS Output Example}

\ccc{Complete_parameterization_example.C} is a complete parameterization
example that outputs the result as an EPS image.
It gets the $(u,v)$ fields computed by a
parameterization method over a \ccc{Polyhedron_3} mesh with a
\ccc{Parameterization_polyhedron_adaptor_3<Polyhedron_3_>} adaptor:
