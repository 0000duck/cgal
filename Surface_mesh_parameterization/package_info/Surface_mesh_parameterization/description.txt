Planar Parameterization of Triangulated Surface Meshes

Parameterizing a surface amounts to finding a one-to-one mapping from a
suitable domain to the surface. In this package, we focus on triangulated
surfaces that are homeomorphic to a disk and on piecewise linear mappings
into a planar domain.

This CGAL package implements several surface mesh parameterization
methods, such as As Rigid As Possible Parameterization, Least Squares Conformal Maps,
Discrete Conformal Map, Discrete Authalic Parameterization,Floater Mean Value Coordinates or
Tutte Barycentric Mapping.

The package proposes an interface with the Boost Graph Library API data structure.
It can thus be used either with Polyhedron_3, Surface_mesh, or any class model of the concept FaceGraph.

Since parameterizing meshes requires an efficient representation of sparse matrices
and efficient iterative or direct linear solvers, we provide links to the standard
library Eigen3.
