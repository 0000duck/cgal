\PkgDesc{Algorithms for computing the Apollonius       graph in two dimensions.  The Apollonius graph is the dual of the       Apollonius diagram, also known as the <I>additively weighted Voronoi       diagram</I>.  The latter can be thought of as the Voronoi diagram of a set       of disks under the Euclidean metric, and it is a generalization of the       standard Voronoi diagram for points.  The algorithms provided are       dynamic.}
