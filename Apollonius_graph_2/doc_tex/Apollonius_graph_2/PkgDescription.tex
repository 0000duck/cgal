\ccPkgSummary{
 Algorithms for computing the Apollonius
      graph in two dimensions.  The Apollonius graph is the dual of the
      Apollonius diagram, also known as the {\em additively weighted Voronoi
      diagram}.  The latter can be thought of as the Voronoi diagram of a set
      of disks under the Euclidean metric, and it is a generalization of the
      standard Voronoi diagram for points.  The algorithms provided are
      dynamic.}
