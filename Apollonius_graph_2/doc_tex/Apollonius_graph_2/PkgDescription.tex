\begin{ccPkgDescription}{2D Apollonius Graphs (Delaunay Graphs of Disks)}
\ccPkgSummary{
 Algorithms for computing the Apollonius
      graph in two dimensions.  The Apollonius graph is the dual of the
      Apollonius diagram, also known as the additively weighted Voronoi
      diagram.  The latter can be thought of as the Voronoi diagram of a set
      of circles under the Euclidean metric, and it is a generalization of the
      standard Voronoi diagram for points.  The algorithms provided are
      dynamic.}
