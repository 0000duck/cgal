- created ApolloniusGraph_2 namespace
- put all predicates under the new namespace (including the new predicates)
- fixed test suite for new traits wrt calling the new orientation
  predicate
- removed code that is no longer used due to the removal of Filtered_exact

18 July 2006:  Menelaos Karavelas

  so that it does not clutter the CGAL include directory; also
  changes to dont_submit and test directory due to this
- fixed various traits classes according to new directory structure
- correct functors are now called
- old orientation predicate is called in new traits; the new one seems
  to have problems (Christophe?)

17 July 2006:  Menelaos Karavelas

  separate files.

13 July 2006: Christophe Delage

12 July 2006: Christophe Delage
- added a new traits class in include/CGAL/new_traits

  Rafael Torres <rtorres@dimm.upv.es> for spotting the bug.

1 May 2006:  Menelaos Karavelas
- fixed bug introduced in compute_points() in Parabola_2 class during

9 March 2006:  Menelaos Karavelas
- changed default background color from yellow to black
- gave the example files some more meaningful names
- capitalized headings in user manual
- attempt to fix sunpro warnings
- "fixed" code when run with a number type that does not
  support / and sqrt ("fixed" here means that the code still runs but
  operations are no longer exact; the operations that are not exact
  are only used for constructions, not for predicates); the issue
  came up in the segment Delaunay graph package which uses the
  Parabola_2 and Parabola_segment_2 from this package.

8 March 2006:  Menelaos Karavelas
- demos now include CGAL/basic.h before testing for Qt; this is essential
  due to the recent changes in install_cgal

17 December 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- fixed chapter names in doc

30 November 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- added one more version of the orientation predicate, needed for
  locating on edges of the Apollonius graph (addition in
  code/predicates/traits and doc).
- fixed broken file inclusion: the error was due to the
  renaming/rearranging of the segment Delaunay graph package.

21 November 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- fixed problem with toolbars under linux. The toolbars stopped being
  visible once the menus where added. This has now been fixed.
- added view menu; the user can now choose the background color among
  three: white, black, yellow.

6 August 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- fixed unreachable statement warnings produced by pgCC
- fixed bug in construction of bisector ray
- fixed bug in computation of conflicts: if the query site destroys
  everything the edge list is empty, which was not handled correctly.

31 July 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- fixed wrong assignments of signs to FT in compare_quadratic.h

30 July 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas

30 June 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- added get_conflicts() methods (similar to those in regular and Delaunay
  triangulations); need to update the doc and the testsuite also.

26 June 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- doc: added Triangulation_data_structure type and tds() method; also added
  that the Apollonius_graph_2 class is a model of the DelaunayGraph_2 concept.
- doc: added Vertex and Face types in the Apollonius_graph_2 class; fixed
  some errors in the definition of the various iterators/circulators.
- AG2 class: almost all combinatorial types are now defined through Agds and 
  not the triangulation (except the Finite_*_iterator types).

21 June 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- removed unused code related to homogeneous coordinates/representations
- changed code in traits to minimize function/method calls
- renamed some methods

- added about boxes in demo.

13 June 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- changed messages/captions of the file toolbar of the demo program

4 June 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- Apollonius_graph_2 and Apollonius_graph_hierarchy_2: added methods file_input
  and file_output that read and write from and to a file. The data written
  consists of the visible and hidden sites and the triangulation data
  structure; in the case of the hierarchy, the entire hierarchy is encoded.
- Apollonius_graph_2 and Apollonius_graph_hierarchy_2: added operator>> and
  operator<< that read and write from and to a stream; the methods file_input
  and file_output are used to implement the two operators.
- modified the test suite to test the above mentioned I/O functionality.
- updated documentation to reflect the newly added I/O functionality.

1 June 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- added types Arity and result_type in Construct_Apollonius_vertex_2.
- in Construct_Apollonius_*_2: the constructor object for the Apollonius
  site or vertex is now taken from the geometric traits.
- fixed bug in visualization of primal Apollonius graph when the dual Voronoi
  edge is degenerate (zero length).

- calls to mirror_vertex and mirror_index made through the faces are
  now made through the TDS

- added the types Vertex, Face and Triangulation_data_structure in the
  Apollonius_graph_2 class; these types should also appear in the doc of
  the class

17 May 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- changed maintainer's email

27 April 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- fixed misprint sent by Anatoly.Zaretksy <anatoly.zaretsky@gmail.com>
  in method: Object_2 dual(const Face_handle& f) of Apollonius_graph_2

7 March 2005:  Menelaos Karavelas
- replaced calls to the vertex handle methods degree() and
  incident_{edges,faces}() by calls to the corresponding TDS methods that
  take the vertex as argument. This was done in compliance with the latest
  changes in the design of the Triangulation_2 software.
- modified test suite to comply with the above change
- added access method in Apollonius_graph_2 that returns a const reference
  to the TDS.
- added fix for a nasty warning on the PowerPC version of G++ 3.4

4 October 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- removed "\ccInclude{iostream}" from Apollonius_site_2.tex in the reference
  manual; it was causing the manual tools to post a warning

10 September 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- test.h: fixed typo that was creating an error in Microsoft and
  Intel compilers.

7 September 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas

5 June 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas
- changed name of line argument in Parabola_2 constructor to avoid
  warning of SunPro CC compiler

14 May 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- warning of SunPro CC 5.30 for uninitialized variable in
  Ag2_infinite_edge_test_C2.h

13 May 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- replaced Vertex_handle(NULL) by Vertex_handle()
- replaced comparisons of vertex and face handles against NULL by
  comparisons against {Vertex,Face}_handle()

26 April 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- CC-5.30_SunOS-5.8 was complaining about the static constants of the
  Parabola_2 and Hyperbola_ray_2 classes; these constants are now given
  my static methods

25 April 2004:  Menelaos Karavelas <mkaravel@cse.nd.edu>
- changes in the traits: moved the various functors from
  predicates/Apollonius_graph_predicates_C2.h to separate files named
  predicates/Ag2_*.h; the two traits classes have been appropriately modified
- the Apollonius_graph_face_base_2.h file no longer exists; changed the data
  structures so that the requirement is now Triangulation_gace_base_2<Gt>;
  this reduces the memory requirements
- the version before these (major) changes can be recovered using the tag
  before_design_changes_April_2004
- the doc has been appropriately modified to reflect the changes in the
  requirements of the face base class
- the doc for the Apollonius_graph_2 class has been modified to define
  size_type; also the types that are typedefs from the data structure are now
  defined as typedefs instead of nested types

13 April 2004 Menelaos Karavelas 
- split the apollonius graph test suite into three separate parts;
  this will hopefully decrease compilation time and memory requirements
  for the compilation

  Qt_widget.h is not used in these files.

1.60 (5 January 2004) [mk]
