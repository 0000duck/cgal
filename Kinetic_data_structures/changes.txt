9 March 2006 Joachim Reichel
- LGPL copyright notice added to src/CGALQt/kds{,_deps}.makefile

9 March 2006 Andreas Fabri
- Made heading of user and reference manual to be the same

July 2006 Daniel Russel
- removed time in process function calls
- changed Simulator to Default_simulator

August 2006 Daniel Russel
- added set_has_certificates to Delaunay_2
- added degeneracy handling to Event (a set of new, optional methods)--All events should inherit from Event_base
- infinity is not needed for roots any more

- to_static replaced with Current_coordinates functor in instantaneous kernel
- the Delaunay_triangulation_2 doesn't require that the Triangulation use an Instantaneous_kernel (if you don't insert or erase)
- removed set_end_time/set_end_priority replaced with set_interval

September 2006 Daniel Russel
- added event auditing
- change has_rational_current_time to has_current_time_as_nt() to one function next_time_representable_as_nt
- changed some NT to FT to be consistent with CGAL
- collapsed polynomial_NS::Sign into CGAL::Sign
- you must check if a certificate fails or not before accessing the root
- added example for defining a simulation_traits class
- standardize names in kinetickernel to be those of the cgal kernels
- standardized look of functionkernel predicates to take all arguments at once
- changed Sign_above to Sign_after
- computation of the sign after the current time is now exposed through the kinetic predicates
- traits classes are now dimension independent
- Kinetic_kernel now called Kinetic::Cartesian to be consistent with the
  static one
