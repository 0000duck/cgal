\subsection{Using a provided kinetic data structure \label{sec:kds_sort_example}}


Using a kinetic data structure can be as simple as the following:
\label{fig:kds_sort_program}
\ccIncludeExampleCode{Kinetic_data_structures/sort.C}

In the example, first the \ccc{Kinetic::SimulationTraits} object is chosen
(in this case one that supports exact computations). Then the kinetic
data structure is defined using the chosen traits object and a
visitor class which logs changes to the sorted list.  Next, instances
of the two are created and a set of points is read from a file. Then,
the simulator is instructed to process all the events until the end of
the simulation.  Finally, a record of what happened is printed to the
terminal.

Several important things happen behind the scenes in this example.
First, the \ccc{Kinetic::ActiveObjectsTable} which holds the moving
points notifies the kinetic data structure that new points have been
added to the simulation. Second, the
\ccc{Kinetic::Sort<Traits,Visitor>} kinetic data structure registers
its events with the \ccc{Kinetic::Simulator} by providing a time and a
proxy object for each event. When a particular event occurs, the
\ccc{Kinetic::Simulator} calls a function on the proxy object which in turn
updates the kinetic data structure.

The example illustrates how to monitor the supplied data structures as
they evolve by using a \ccc{Kinetic::SortVisitor} object---a small class whose
methods are called whenever the kinetic data structure changes. Hooks
for such visitor concepts are provided for all of the shipped kinetic
data structures. In the case of kinetic sorting, the visitor's
methods are called every time a new point is inserted in the sorted
list, when one is removed, or when two points are swapped in the
sorted order. 


The visitor concept is quite powerful, allowing us, for example, to
implement a data structure for computing and storing two-dimensional
arrangements of $x$-monotone curves on top of the
\ccc{Kinetic::Sort<Traits, Visitor>} data structure using about 60
lines of code. This sweepline code is presented in
Section~\ref{sec:kds_sweepline_example}.

%\subsection{Constructing Primitives}
%\label{sec:kds_constructing_primitives}

One key part of the framework not shown is how to create kinetic
primitives (rather than just reading them in from a file). There are
two ways to construction the necessary motion functions (which are
models of \ccc{Kinetic::FunctionKernel::Function}). The first is to
create an array of polynomial coeffients and simply call the
constructor as in:
\begin{ccExampleCode}
typedef Traits::Kinetic_kernel::Motion_function F;
std::vector<F::NT> coefs;
coefs.push_back(F::NT(1.0));
coefs.push_back(F::NT(2.0));
F x(coefs.begin(), coefs.end());
\end{ccExampleCode}

A slightly more flexible way is to use a
\ccc{Kinetic::FunctionKernel::ConstructFunction} object. To do this do the following:
\begin{ccExampleCode}
typedef Traits::Kinetic_kernel::Function_kernel::Construct_function
CF; typedef Traits::Kinetic_kernel::Motion_function F; CF cf; F
x=cf(F::NT(1.0), F::NT(2.0));
\end{ccExampleCode}
The \ccc{Kinetic::FunctionKernel::ConstructFunction} can be passed
(almost) an number of arguments and will construct a polynomial with
those arguments are coefficients.

Once the motion functions are constructed, constructing the primitive
is just like constructing the corresponding static object.
\begin{ccExampleCode}
typedef Traits::Kinetic_kernel::Point_1 Point_1;
Point_1 p(x);
\end{ccExampleCode}
