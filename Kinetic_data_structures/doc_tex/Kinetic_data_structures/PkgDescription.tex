\ccPkgSummary{

Kinetic data structures allow combinatorial structures to be
maintained as the primitives move. The package provides
implementations of kinetic data structures for Delaunay triangulations
in two and three dimensions, sorting of points in one dimension and
regular triangulations in three dimensions. In addition, the package
provides a framework to ease implementing and debugging kinetic data
structures. The package supports exact or inexact operations on
primitives which move along polynomial trajectories.  }

\ccPkgDependsOn{*Two dimensional visualization depends on \ccc{Qt}, three dimensional visualization depends on \ccc{Coin}. }
