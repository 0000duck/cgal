\section{Examples}
\label{sec:examples}

We provide a number of examples of different levels of usage of the
kinetic data structures framework, both for kinetic data structures as
well as sweepline algorithms.

The first example ( in Section~\ref{sec:delaunay_2_example}) showed
how to used a data structure which maintains a sorted list of points
to compute the arrangement of a set of x-monotone curves in the
plane. Using the other kinetic data structures is substantially
identical. Please see the appropriate files in the
demo/Kinetic\_data\_structures directory.

The next examples cover implementing kinetic data structures. They are
\begin{itemize}
\item Adding a certificate generator to a kernel
\item A trivial kinetic data structure which has all the parts of a
full kinetic data structure but doesn't do much in
Section~\ref{sec:trivial_kds_example}
\item The implementation of the sweepline arrangement computation in
  Section~\ref{sec:sweepline_example}
\end{itemize}

In order to see more detail about how to implement a kinetic data structure, the best place to start is the source code for the kinetic sorting data structure, \ccc{CGAL::Kinetic::Sort<Traits, Visitor>}.
