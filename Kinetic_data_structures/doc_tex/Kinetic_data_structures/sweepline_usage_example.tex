\subsection{A Sweepline Algorithm}
\label{sec:sweepline_example}

Here we present a simple example that uses the kinetic data structures
framework to implement a sweepline to compute the arrangement of
x-monotone algebraic curves in the plane. The arrangement and the
curves are then output as a metapost file which can be converted into
a postscript file to view using the mpost command. The code is very
simple and written to be read.

The example code is rather large (but fairly straight foward) and
there is not included in the manual. Please see the file in the
\texttt{examples/Kinetic\_data\_structures} directory.
