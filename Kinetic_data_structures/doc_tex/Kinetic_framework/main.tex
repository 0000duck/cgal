This chapter describes a framework for implementing kinetic data
structures and sweepline algorithms. If you just would like to use
existing kinetic data structures, please read
Chapter~\ref{chapter-kds} instead. Readers wishing to brush up on
their familiarity with kinetic data structures or better understand
the terminology we use should read Section~\ref{sec:kds_intro}.  A brief
overview of the framework can be found in
Section~\ref{sec:kds_overview} of that chapter and it is also
recommended reading. Here we dive right in to discussing to discussing
the architecture of the framework in Section~\ref{sec:kds_architecture}
and finally we give several examples of using the framework to
implement a kinetic data structure in Section~\ref{sec:kds_examples}. The
framework makes heavy use of our \ccc{Polynomial_kernel} package to
provide models of the \ccc{Kinetic::FunctionKernel} concept.

The framework was first presented at ALENEX~\cite{cgal:gkr-cfhm-04}.
