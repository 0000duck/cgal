\begin{ccPkgDescription}{Kinetic Framework\label{Pkg:KdsFramework}}
\ccPkgSummary{
Kinetic data structures allow combinatorial geometric structures to be
maintained as the primitives move. The package provides a framework to
ease implementing and debugging kinetic data structures. The package
supports exact or inexact operations on primitives which move along
polynomial trajectories.  }

\ccPkgDependsOn{Two dimensional visualization depends on  \ccThirdPartyQt, three dimensional visualization depends on \ccThirdPartyCoin. }
\ccPkgMaturity{Introduced in \cgal\ 3.2}
