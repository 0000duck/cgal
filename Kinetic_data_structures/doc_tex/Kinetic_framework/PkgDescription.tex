\ccPkgSummary{

Kinetic data structures allow combinatorial geometric structures to be
maintained as the primitives move. The package provides a framework to
ease implementing and debugging kinetic data structures. The package
supports exact or inexact operations on primitives which move along
polynomial trajectories.  }

\ccPkgDependsOn{Two dimensional visualization depends on \ccc{Qt}, three dimensional visualization depends on \ccc{Coin}. }
\ccPkgMaturity{Introduced in \cgal\ 3.2}
