\PkgDesc{Kinetic data structures allow combinatorial geometric structures to be maintained as the primitives move. The package provides a framework to ease implementing and debugging kinetic data structures. The package supports exact or inexact operations on primitives which move along polynomial trajectories.  }

\PkgDescriptionEnd

Kinetic data structures are a way of adding motion to classical
geometric data structures. \cgal provides a number of classes to aid
implementation of kinetic data structures.

There are three levels at which the user can interact with the
package. The user can use an existing kinetic data structure, write a
new kinetic data structure, or replace parts of the framework.The
first level is covered in the Chapter  \ref Chapter_Kinetic_Framework.
