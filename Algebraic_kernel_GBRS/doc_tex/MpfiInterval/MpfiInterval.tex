\begin{ccPkgDescription}{MpfiInterval \label{MpfiInterval}}

MPFI is an arbitrary-precision interval-arithmetic library developed at INRIA
by N. Revol and F. Rouillier
(see \emph{http://gforge.inria.fr/projects/mpfi/}).
It is based on the MPFR arbitrary precision floating-point number library (see
\emph{http://www.mpfr.org/}), itself based on the GMP arbitrary-precision
integer library (see \emph{www.swox.com/gmp}).
MPFI is used by FGb-RS, a program developed by J. C. Faug\`ere and F. Rouillier
which computes the real roots of polynomials systems.

The library provides a complete set of functions that deal with the arithmetics
of intervals of arbitrary-precision floating point numbers.

The present number type adapts all functions provided by the MPFI library so
that MPFI intervals can be used in {\cgal}.
