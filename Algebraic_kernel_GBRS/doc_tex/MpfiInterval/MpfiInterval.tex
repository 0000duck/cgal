\begin{ccPkgDescription}{MpfiInterval \label{MpfiInterval}}

MPFI is an interval library, it can be found in
\emph{http://gforge.inria.fr/projects/mpfi/}.
Its implementation uses the MPFR arbitrary precision number library.
It is used by GB and RS, programs that solve systems of multivariate
polynomials.

The present interface adapt the C functions provided by the library to be
used as a number type in {\cgal}, planning to include GB/RS support in a
short term.
