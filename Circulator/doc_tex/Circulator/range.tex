\section{Ranges} 

Most data structures in \cgal\ use the concept of an iterator range.  The
\ccc{Range} and \ccc{ConstRange} concepts encapsulate the access to the first
and the past-the-end iterators of an iterator range.  STL containers are models
of \ccc{Range}.  The Boost.Range library provides good support around this
concept as well.
