\ccPkgSummary{
A Nef polygon is any set that can be obtained from a
finite set of open halfspaces by set complement and set intersection
operations. Due to the fact that all other binary set operations like
union, difference and symmetric difference can be reduced to
intersection and complement calculations, Nef polygons are also closed
under those operations. Apart from the set complement operation there
are more topological unary set operations that are closed in the
domain of Nef polygons interior, boundary, and closure.}
