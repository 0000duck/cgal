\ccPkgSummary{
An efficient algorithm for finding all intersecting pairs for large
numbers of iso-oriented boxes, in order to apply a user defined callback
on them.  Ypically these boxes will be bounding
boxes of more complicated geometries. The algorithm is useful for (self-) intersection
tests of surfaces etc.
