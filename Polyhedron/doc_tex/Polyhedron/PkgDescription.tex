\ccPkgSummary{Polyhedral surfaces in three dimensions are composed of
vertices, edges, facets and an incidence relationship on them. The
organization beneath is a halfedge data structure, which restricts the
class of representable surfaces to orientable 2-manifolds - with and
without boundary. If the surface is closed we call it a polyhedron.}
