- The following file has not yet been ported to the plugin stuff:
    MainWindow_curvature_estimation.cpp
- The cut plugin has memory leaks. And the AABB tree item should be updated
  when the corresponding items are changed().

related to the MERGE with Point_set_demo:
 - clean up Point_set_3.h and UI_point_3.h
 - we should probably have a points_item
 - Points and normal should be seperated items (pb with select and remove)
 - what about splatting? 
 - remaining plugins to port:
    - PS_demo_local_spacing_plugin.cpp
    - PS_demo_average_spacing_plugin.cpp
 - import ContextMenu from branch and make Polyhedron_scene_item exportable as point set and point set with normals
