cross-platform application development.

\section{Introduction}

This chapter describes classes that help to visualize two dimensional \cgal\ objects
with the \qt\ GraphicsView framework.

This framework uses the model view paradigm. GraphicsItems are stored in a 
GraphicsScene and can be displayed in serveral GraphicsViews. The items 
have a paint method which is called when an item is in the visible area of a view.
The framework is also responsible for dispatching events from the view
via the scene to the items. The framework is extensible in the sense
that users can write new GraphicsItems, and that is what this package is
about. 

Besided visualizing GraphicsItems users want to enter geometric objects.
We provide the input generators for all 2D \cgal\ kernel objects.

The package includes also the class \ccc{QtNavigation} providing zooming,
panning, and scrolling.


The following sections describe the interaction between all these classes.
