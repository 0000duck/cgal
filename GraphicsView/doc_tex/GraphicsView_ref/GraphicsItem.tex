\begin{ccRefClass}[Qt::]{GraphicsItem}

\ccDefinition
The \cgal\ graphics items hold pointers to \cgal\ datastructures. When a datastructure changes, 
a signal is emitted. An object derived from type \ccRefName\ must provide an implementation of the 
virtual slot \ccc{modelChanged()}.  This typically triggers redrawing, as well as recomputation 
of the bounding box which in turn may trigger redrawing of overlapping graphics items.
