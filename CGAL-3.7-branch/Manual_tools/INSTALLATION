Installation
============

System Requirements:

     *  C/C++ Compiler (tested: Gnu g++ 3.3 and 3.4)
     *  flex and bison (NOTE: flex versions >  2.5.4 are NOT yet supported)
     *  perl 5
     *  Unix environment with tools like grep, sed, awk, ...
     *  GNU make


There is an install script called `install.sh' that installs the 
Manual_tools in a default location, specified in `install.config'. 
If you dislike the default paths, feel free to change them. Some 
interactive work is still required:

(1)  The default location for TeX style files is 
     ${HOME}/local/Manual_tools/sty. You have to ensure that TeX has 
     access to this path, by setting the $TEXINPUTS environment 
     variable:

     $ export TEXINPUTS=".:`pwd`/format:$TEXINPUTS"          
     
       
(2)  The directory `scripts/' contains scripts that assume csh and perl
     to be located at /bin/csh and /usr/bin/perl. These scripts may need 
     to be edited (before installing them, of course) to reflect the proper 
     locations.

     An example file `cc_ref_wizard_rc' is provided for user configurations
     in `$HOME/.cc_ref_wizard_rc'.

(3)  If you use the Manual_tools in the CGAL context, make sure that the 
     cgal_manual script (found in Manual/developer_scripts/cgal_manual) 
     is in the PATH, either by copying it to ~/local/bin or by other means.

(4)  The directory `src/' contains the supporting tools. See src/INSTALLATION
     for further details (not required for basic setup).
