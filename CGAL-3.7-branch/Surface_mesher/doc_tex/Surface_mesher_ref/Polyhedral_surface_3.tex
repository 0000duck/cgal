\begin{ccRefClass}{Polyhedral_surface_3<Traits>}

\ccDefinition

The class \ccRefName\  implements a surface described as a polyhedron. That
polyhedron is supposed to represent a piecewise smooth surface, potentially
with borders.

For each regular edge of the polyhedron, if its dihedral angle is greater
than a given bound, that edge is called a \emph{smooth edge}.

The 1D curves of the surface is the union of border edges and non-smooth
edges.

For this type of surface, the library provides a partial specialization
of the  surface mesher traits generator:
\ccc{Surface_mesh_traits_generator_3<Polyhedral_surface_3<Traits> >},
that provides a traits class, model of the concept
\ccc{SurfaceMeshTraits_3}, to be used by the surface mesh generator.

\ccConstructor{
Polyhedral_surface_3(std::istream& off_stream,
                     const FT cosine_bound)}
{\ccc{off_tream} is an STL input stream whose content has the OFF
  format. \ccc{cosine_bound} is a positive upper bound on the cosine of the
  dihedral angle at a smooth edge.}
