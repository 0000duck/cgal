\ccc{ET} is a model of the concepts \ccc{IntegralDomain} and
\ccc{RealEmbeddable}; it must
be an exact type, and all entries of \ccc{qp} are convertible to 
\ccc{ET}.

Here are some recommended combinations of input type (the type of
the \ccc{qp} entries) and \ccc{ET}.

\begin{tabular}{lll} 
input type        &| &  \ccc{ET} \\ \hline
\ccc{double}      &| & \ccc{MP_Float}, \ccc{Gmpzf}, or \ccc{Gmpq} \\
\ccc{int}         &| & \ccc{MP_Float}, or \ccc{Gmpz} \\
any exact type \ccc{NT} &|&  \ccc{NT}
\end{tabular}

{\bf Note:} by default, this function performs a large number of 
runtime-checks to ensure consistency during the solution process.
However, these checks slow down the computations by a considerable
factor. For maximum efficiency, it is advisable to define the macros
\texttt{CGAL\_QP\_NO\_ASSERTIONS} or \texttt{NDEBUG}.
