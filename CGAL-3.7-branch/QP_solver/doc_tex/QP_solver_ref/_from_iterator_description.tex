This class is simply a wrapper for existing iterators, and it does not
copy the program data.

It frequently happens that all values in one of the vectors from
above are the same, for example if the system $Ax\qprel b$ is 
actually a system of equations $Ax=b$. To get an iterator over such a 
vector, it is not necessary to store multiple copies of the value in
some container; an instance of the class \ccc{Const_oneset_iterator<T>},
constructed from the value in question, does the job more efficiently.
