\section{Introduction}

\cgal ~is targeting towards exact computation with non-linear objects, 
in particular objects defined on algebraic curves and surfaces. 
As a consequence types representing polynomials, algebraic extensions and 
finite fields play a more important role in related implementations. 
This package has been introduced to stay abreast of these changes. 
Since in particular polynomials must be supported by the introduced framework
the package avoids the term {\em number type}. Instead the package distinguishes 
between the {\em algebraic structure} of a type and whether a type is embeddable on 
the real axis, or {\em real embeddable} for short. 
Moreover, the package introduces the notion of {\em interoperable} types which 
allows an explicit handling of mixed operations. 
%In particular it is possible to access the result type of a binary operation.
