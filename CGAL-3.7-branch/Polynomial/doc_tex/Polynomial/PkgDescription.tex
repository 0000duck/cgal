\ccPkgSummary{
This package introduces a concept \ccc{Polynomial_d}, a concept for multivariate 
polynomials in $d$ variables. Though the concept is written for an arbitrary 
number of variables, the number of variables is considered as fixed for a 
particular model of \ccc{Polynomial_d}. The concept covers univariate 
polynomials as well.}
