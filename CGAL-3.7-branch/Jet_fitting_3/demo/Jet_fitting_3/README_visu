-pre-requisite 0: check out introspect, jet_fitting_3

-pre-requisite 1: introspect requires glut. under fedora, install
freeglut-devel. (wizards's corner: as root, use synaptic .. instead of
running a manual installation with rpm -i etc)


-in the introspec dir, a target lib allows to create a small archive,
libIntrospect.a, which can then be used from anywhere

-to use the library for/from any package:

*set INTROSPEC_DIR variable in the makefile, and use it for the
includes and the final link with -lIntrospect

Program introspect-qt
----------------

takes as input
1. a file.off,
2. the corresponding file file.off.4ogl.txt computed with the example program 
	blind from file.off 

it displays an OpenGL view of both the mesh and the ppal directions

./introspect-qt ../../examples/Jet_fitting_3/data/poly2x\^2+y\^2-0.062500-off ../../examples/Jet_fitting_3/data_poly2x\^2+y\^2-0.062500-off.4ogl.txt
