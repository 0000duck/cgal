\section{Unique Hash Map}

The class \ccc{Unique_hash_map} implements an injective mapping between
a set of unique keys and a set of data values.  This is implemented using
a chained hashing scheme and access operations take $O(1)$ expected time.
Such a mapping is useful, for example, when keys are pointers, 
handles, iterators or circulators that refer to unique memory locations.
In this case, the default hash function is \ccc{Handle_hash_function}.
