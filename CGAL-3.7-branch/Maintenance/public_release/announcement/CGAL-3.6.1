Subject: CGAL 3.6.1 Released, Computational Geometry Algorithms Library
Body:

The CGAL Open Source Project is pleased to announce the release 3.6.1 of
CGAL, the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library.

Version 3.6.1 is a bug-fix release for version 3.6. No new feature has 
been added in 3.6.1.  The following corrections have been made:


1. General

  - Fix compilation errors with recent Boost versions (since 1.40).

  - Initial support for the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler 10.0 (MSVC
    2010).
    For that support, CMake>=2.8.2 is required.  Note also that the
    compiler option "/bigobj" is necessary to compile some CGAL programs
    with MSVC 2010.  The Windows installer CGAL-3.6.1-Setup.exe does not
    support VC++10. The source tarball must be downloaded instead and unpacked
    manually. Precompiled binaries of GMP and MPFR must be downloaded from
    GForge:
        https://gforge.inria.fr/frs/?group_id=52
    Download either gmp-5.0.1_and_mpfr-3.0.0_precompiled_i686.zip (for 
    32 bits compilers) or gmp-5.0.1_and_mpfr-3.0.0_precompiled_x64.zip (for
    64 bits compilers) and unpack that zip file directly into the
    sub-directory auxiliary/gmp/ of the unpacked sources directory
    CGAL-3.6.1/. So that the files are put in
    CGAL-3.6.1/auxilary/gmp/include/ and CGAL-3.6.1/auxilary/gmp/lib/. Then
    continue with the CMake configuration and the compilation, as
    instructed in the installation manual.


2. Polynomial

  - Fix compilation errors with the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler and the
    Intel C++ compiler.


3. Polyhedron

  - Fix a compilation errors in demo/Polyhedron/:
     - issue with the location of qglobal.h of Qt4 on MacOS X,
     - missing texture.cpp, if TAUCS is used,
  - Fix the location of built plugins of demo/Polyhedron/, when CGAL is
    configured with WITH_demos=ON
  - Fix a bug in test_facet function of the incremental builder:    
    the function did not test if while a new facet makes a vertex manifold,
    no other facet incident to that vertex breaks the manifold property.


4. 3D Periodic Triangulations

  - Fixed bug in the triangulation hierarchy for periodic triangulations.


5. 2D Mesh Generation

  - Fix a bug that lead to precondition violation.
  - Improve the user manual about the member function is_in_domain() of the
    Face type.
  - The 2D meshing process is now deterministic (sorting of bad faces no
    longer relies on pointers comparisons).


6. 3D Mesh Generation

  - Fix a linking errors (duplicate symbols) when <CGAL/refine_mesh_3.h> is
    included in different compilation units.


7. Spatial Searching

  - Fix a bug in <CGAL/Orthogonal_k_neighbor_search.h> when several
    nearest neighbors are at the same distance from the query point.

8. IO Streams

  - Fix a bug in <CGAL/IO/VRML_2_ostream.h> that generated VRML 2 files with
    an invalid syntax for IndexedFaceSet nodes.
    
9. Triangulation_2

  - Add missing Compare_distance_2 functor in trait classes
    Triangulation_euclidean_traits_xy_3 Triangulation_euclidean_traits_yz_3
    and Triangulation_euclidean_traits_xz_3.  This was preventing calling
    member function nearest_vertex of Delaunay_triangulation_2 instantiated
    with one of these traits.
