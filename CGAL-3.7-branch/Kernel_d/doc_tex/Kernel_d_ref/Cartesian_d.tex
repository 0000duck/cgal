\ccDefinition
A model for \ccc{Kernel_d} that uses \ccHtmlNoLinksFrom{Cartesian} coordinates to represent the
geometric objects.  In order for \ccRefName\ to model Euclidean geometry
in $E^d$ , for some mathematical field $E$ (\textit{e.g.},
the rationals \Q\ or the reals \R), the template parameter \ccc{FieldNumberType} 
must model the mathematical field $E$.  That is, the field operations on this
number type must compute the mathematically correct results.  If the number 
type provided as a model for \ccc{FieldNumberType} is only an approximation of a 
field (such as the built-in type \ccc{double}), then the geometry provided by 
the kernel is only an approximation of Euclidean geometry.
