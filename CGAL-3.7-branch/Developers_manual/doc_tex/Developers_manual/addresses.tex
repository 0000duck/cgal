There are a number of mailing lists and email addresses that have been set
up to communicate with various subsets of the \cgal\ community.  The
addresses that should be of interest to \cgal\ developers are as follows.
The up-to-date addresses and archives can be found on the web site.

     at any time about any \cgal\ design issues.
