\section{Introduction}

Many geometric algorithms implemented in \cgal\ are incremental, and thus their
speed is dependent on the order of insertion.  This package provides sorting
algorithms that may considerably improve running times of such
algorithms.

The rationale is to sort objects along a space-filling curve so that two
objects close geometrically will be close in the insertion order with high
probability.  That way, parts of a data structure that will be looked at during
an insertion will probably have been looked at in a recent insertion, and thus
probably will be in cache memory instead of main memory.

As another side-effect, these sorting functions usually improve memory locality
of the data structures produced by incremental algorithms, sometimes leading to
speed ups in other algorithm using these data structures.
