\ccPkgSummary{This package contains algorithms for minimizing linear and
convex quadratic functions over polyhedral domains, described by linear
equations and inequalities. The algorithms are exact, i.e. the solution
is computed in terms of multiprecision rational numbers.

The resulting solution is certified: along with the claims that the
problem under consideration has an optimal solution, is infeasible,
or is unbounded, the algorithms also deliver proofs for these facts.
These proofs can easily (and independently from the algorithms) be 
checked for correctness.

The solution algorithms expect the linear and quadratic programs to
be in dense format, and they also compute with this dense representation
internally. Adapters are provided to bring sparse programs (as encoded in
MPS format, for example) into the required dense representation, but the 
ability to solve large, sparse problems is limited.

The solver is efficient if the minimum of the number of variables
(columns) and the number of constraints (rows) is of moderate size
(100, say).

The solution algorithms are based on a generalization of the simplex 
method to quadratic objective functions.
