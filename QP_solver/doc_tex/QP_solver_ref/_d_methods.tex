\ccMethod{D_iterator get_d() const;}{returns an iterator for the rows of
  $2D$. For $i=0,\ldots,n-1$, $\ccc{*(get_d()+i)}$ is a random access
  iterator for the entries in row $i$ \emph{below or on the diagonal}.
  The valid range of this iterator is 
  guaranteed to have length $i+1$ but not more. Values to the right 
  of the diagonal are deduced from the symmetry requirement on $D$.}
