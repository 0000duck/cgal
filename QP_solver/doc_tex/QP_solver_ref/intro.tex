\ccHeading{Classes}

There is a class that represents the solution of a linear
or quadratic program. An instance of this class is returned by any of 
the solution functions below.

We offer a number of predefined models for the program concepts. These
construct linear or quadratic programs from iterators, or from streams.

Here are the models that conform to the concept 
\ccc{QuadraticProgramInterface}. 

\ccc{Quadratic_program<NT>}\\
$\quad$ (for quadratic programs that own their data and are built entry-wise; probably the most useful model)\\
\ccc{Quadratic_program_from_iterators<A_it, B_it,  R_it, FL_it, L_it, FU_it, U_it, D_it, C_it>}\\
$\quad$ (for quadratic programs that wrap given iterators, without copying 
data) \\
\ccc{Quadratic_program_from_pointers<NT>}\\
$\quad$ (for quadratic programs that wrap given pointers, without copying 
data) \\
\ccc{Quadratic_program_from_mps<NT>}\\
$\quad$ (for quadratic programs read from an input stream in 
\ccc{MPSFormat}; the constructed program can be manipulate entry-wise)

These are the models for \ccc{LinearProgramInterface}.

\ccc{Linear_program<NT>}\\
$\quad$ (for linear programs that own their data and are built entry-wise; probably the most useful model)\\
\ccc{Linear_program_from_iterators<A_it, B_it,  R_it, FL_it, L_it, FU_it, U_it, C_it>}\\
$\quad$ (for linear programs that wrap given iterators, without copying 
data) \\
\ccc{Linear_program_from_pointers<NT>}\\
$\quad$ (for linear programs that wrap given pointers, without copying 
data) \\
\ccc{Linear_program_from_mps<NT>}\\ 
$\quad$ (for linear programs read from an input stream in 
\ccc{MPSFormat}; the constructed program can be manipulate entry-wise)

For \ccc{NonnegativeQuadraticProgramInterface}, we offer these
four models.

\ccc{Nonnegative_quadratic_program<NT>}\\
$\quad$ (for nonnegative quadratic programs that own their data and are built entry-wise; probably the most useful model)\\
\ccc{Nonnegative_quadratic_program_from_iterators<A_it, B_it, R_it,  D_it, C_it>}\\
$\quad$ (for nonnegative quadratic programs, wrapping given iterators)\\
\ccc{Nonnegative_quadratic_program_from_pointers<NT>}\\
$\quad$ (for nonnegative quadratic programs, wrapping given pointers)\\
\ccc{Nonnegative_quadratic_program_from_mps<NT>}\\
$\quad$ (for nonnegative quadratic programs read from an input stream in 
\ccc{MPSFormat}; the constructed program can be manipulate entry-wise)

And finally, the four models for \ccc{NonnegativeLinearProgramInterface}.

\ccc{Nonnegative_linear_program<NT>}\\
$\quad$ (for nonnegative linear programs that own their data and are built entry-wise; probably the most useful model)\\
\ccc{Nonnegative_linear_program_from_iterators<A_it, B_it, R_it, C_it>}\\
$\quad$ (for nonnegative linear programs, wrapping given iterators)\\
\ccc{Nonnegative_linear_program_from_pointers<NT>}\\
$\quad$ (for nonnegative linear programs, wrapping given pointers)\\
\ccc{Nonnegative_linear_program_from_mps<NT>}\\
$\quad$ (for nonnegative linear programs read from an input stream in 
\ccc{MPSFormat}; the constructed programt can be manipulate entry-wise)

\ccHeading{Functions}

In case you want to construct a program from complicated iterators
(whose types you don't know, or simply don't want to bother with), 
we provide four makers.

\ccc{make_quadratic_program_from_iterators}\\
\ccc{make_linear_program_from_iterators}\\
\ccc{make_nonnegative_quadratic_program_from_iterators}\\
\ccc{make_nonnegative_linear_program_from_iterators}

There are four functions to solve a program, one for each program
concept. 

\ccc{solve_quadratic_program}\\
\ccc{solve_linear_program}\\
\ccc{solve_nonnegative_quadratic_program}\\
\ccc{solve_nonnegative_linear_program}

Programs can be written to an output stream in \ccc{MPSFormat}, using
one of the following four functions.

\ccc{print_quadratic_program}\\
\ccc{print_linear_program}\\
\ccc{print_nonnegative_quadratic_program}\\
\ccc{print_nonnegative_linear_program}
