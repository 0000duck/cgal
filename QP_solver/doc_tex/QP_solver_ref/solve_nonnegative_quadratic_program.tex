\begin{ccRefFunction}{solve_nonnegative_quadratic_program}

\ccInclude{CGAL/QP_functions.h}

This function solves a nonnegative quadratic program, using some exact
Integral Domain \ccc{ET} for its computations.   

\ccFunction{template <NonnegativeQuadraticProgramInterface, ET>
  Quadratic_program_solution<ET> solve_nonnegative_quadratic_program 
  (const NonnegativeQuadraticProgramInterface& qp, const ET&);}
{returns the solution of the nonnegative quadratic program \ccc{qp}, solved
with exact number type \ccc{ET}.}

\ccHeading{Requirements}
\ccc{ET} is a model of the concepts \ccc{IntegralDomain} and
\ccc{RealEmbeddable}; it must
be an exact type, and all entries of \ccc{qp} are convertible to 
\ccc{ET}.

{\bf Note:} by default, this function performs a large number of 
runtime-checks to ensure consistency during the solution process.
However, these checks slow down the computations by a considerable
factor. For maximum efficiency, it is advisable to define the macros
\texttt{CGAL\_QP\_NO\_ASSERTIONS} or \texttt{NDEBUG}.
