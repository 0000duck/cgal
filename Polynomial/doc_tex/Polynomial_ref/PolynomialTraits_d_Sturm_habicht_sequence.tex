\ccDefinition

Computes the Sturm-Habicht sequence of a polynomials $f$ of type 
\ccc{PolynomialTraits_d::Polynomial_d} with respect a certain variable $x_i$.
The Sturm-Habicht sequence is similar to the polynomial subresultant sequence
of $f$ and its derivative with respect to $x_i$, but some entries
are multiplied by $-1$. With that, it becomes possible to count
the number of real roots of (univariate) polynomials.
Sturm-Habicht sequences are also sometimes 
called signed subresultant sequences in the literature.
The result is written in an output range, 
starting with the $0$th Sturm-Habicht polynomial (which is equal to
the discriminant of $f$ up to a multiple of the leading coefficient)

\ccOperations
\ccMethod{template<typename OutputIterator>
        OutputIterator operator()(Polynomial_d   f,
                                  OutputIterator out);}
         { computes the Sturm-Habicht sequence of $f$, 
           with respect to the outermost variable. Each element is of type
           \ccc{PolynomialTraits_d::Polynomial_d}.}

\ccMethod{template<typename OutputIterator>
        OutputIterator operator()(Polynomial_d   f,
                                  OutputIterator out,
                                  int i);}
         { computes the Sturm-Habicht sequence of $f$ 
           with respect to the variable $x_i$.}
