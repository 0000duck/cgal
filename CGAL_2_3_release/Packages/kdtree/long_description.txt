CGAL KD-tree impelementation
----------------------------

  The following contains the CGAL KD-tree implementation. The examples/kdtrees/
directory contains three simple examples for the use of kd-trees in 2D, 3D
(using points from the Cgal kernel) and 4D (using user-defined points). 

  The source is under include/CGAL/kdtree_d.h, and it can be used
independently from the rest of CGAL.
