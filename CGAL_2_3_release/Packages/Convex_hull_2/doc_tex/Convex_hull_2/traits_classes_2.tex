\section{Traits Classes}

Each of the functions used to compute convex hulls or extreme points
is paramterized by a traits class, which specifies the types and geometric
primitives to be used in the computation.  There are several implementations 
of 2D traits classes provided in the library.  The class
\ccc{Convex_hull_traits_2<R>}\ccIndexMainItem[C]{Convex_hull_traits_2}
corresponds to the default traits class that provides the types and 
predicates presented in the 2-dimensional \cgal\ kernel in which the input 
points lie.  The class 
\ccc{Convex_hull_constructive_traits<R>}\ccIndexMainItem[C]{Convex_hull_constructive_traits}
is a second traits class based on \cgal\ primitives but differs from
\ccc{Convex_hull_traits_2} in that some of its primitives reuse
intermediate results to speed up computation.
There are also two traits classes defined for the two geometry kernels
provided in \leda\ \cite{mn-l-99} 
(\ccc{Convex_hull_leda_traits_2}\ccIndexMainItem[C]{Convex_hull_leda_traits_2}
and 
\ccc{Convex_hull_rat_leda_traits_2}\ccIndexMainItem[C]{Convex_hull_rat_leda_traits_2}), which provide an easy means of comparison with these kernels.
In addition, there are three projective traits classes 
(\ccc{Convex_hull_projective_xy_traits_2}, 
\ccc{Convex_hull_projective_xz_traits_2}, and 
\ccc{Convex_hull_projective_yz_traits_2}), %
\ccIndexMainItem[C]{Convex_hull_projective_xy_traits_2}%
\ccIndexMainItem[C]{Convex_hull_projective_xz_traits_2}%
\ccIndexMainItem[C]{Convex_hull_projective_yz_traits_2}%
which may be used to compute the convex hull of a set of three-dimensional
points projected into each of the three coordinate planes.
