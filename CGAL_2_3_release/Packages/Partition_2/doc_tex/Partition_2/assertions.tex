\ccIndexAssertionFlag[polygon partitioning]
The assertion flags for this package use \ccc{PARTITION} in their names
({\em e.g.}, \ccc{CGAL_PARTITION_NO_POSTCONDITIONS}).
The precondition checks for the planar polygon partitioning functions
are:  counterclockwise ordering of the input vertices and simplicity of the 
polygon these vertices represent.

\ccIndexSubitem[C]{optimal_convex_partition_2}{postconditions}
\ccIndexSubitem[C]{y_monotone_partition_2}{postconditions}
The postcondition checks are:  simplicity, counterclockwise orientation,
and convexity (or $y$-monotonicity) of the partition polygons
and validity of the partition ({\em i.e.}, the partition polygons are 
nonoverlapping and the union of these polygons is the same as the
original polygon)
