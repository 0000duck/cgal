\PkgDescriptionEnd

This package provides data structures and algorithms for exact and approximate distance browsing,
supporting

- both nearest and furthest neighbor searching,
- both exact and approximate searching,
- (approximate) range searching,
- (approximate) `k`-nearest and `k`-furthest neighbor searching,
- (approximate) incremental nearest and incremental furthest neighbor searching,
- query items representing points and spatial objects.

The spatial searching package consists of the following concepts and
classes that are described in the reference pages.
