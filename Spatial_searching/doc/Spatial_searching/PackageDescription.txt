\PkgDesc{This package implements exact and approximate distance browsing by providing exact and approximate algorithms for range searching, k-nearest and k-furthest neighbor searching, as well as incremental nearest and incremental furthest neighbor searching, where the query items are points in dD Euclidean space.}

\PkgDescriptionEnd

This package provides data structures and algorithms for exact and approximate distance browsing,
supporting

- both nearest and furthest neighbor searching,
- both exact and approximate searching,
- (approximate) range searching,
- (approximate) \f$ k\f$-nearest and \f$ k\f$-furthest neighbor searching,
- (approximate) incremental nearest and incremental furthest neighbor searching,
- query items representing points and spatial objects.

The spatial searching package consists of the following concepts and
classes that are described in the reference pages.
