The concept `MeshCellBase_3` describes the requirements 
for the `Cell` type of the triangulation 
used in the 3D mesh generation process. The type `MeshCellBase_3` refines the concept `RegularTriangulationCellBase_3`. 
The concept `MeshCellBase_3` 
includes a way to store and retrieve 
if a given cell of the triangulation 
is inside the domain or not 
and which subdomain it belongs to 
in case of a multi-domain. 

Moreover, this concept adds four markers per cell to mark the facets 
of the triangulation that are surface facets, 
and four additional helper markers 
used in some operations to mark for instance 
the facets that have been visited. 

This concept also provides storage for the centers of Delaunay surface balls. 
Each surface facet has a Delaunay surface ball, i. e. 
a circumscribing ball, centered 
on an input complex surface patch, 
and empty of triangulation vertices. 
In the following we call `surface center` 
of a surface facet, the center of its biggest Delaunay surface ball.

The optimizers also need this concept to provide read-write access to two `Cell_handle`
called 'intrusive'.
