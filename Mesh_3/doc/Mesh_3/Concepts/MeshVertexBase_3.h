\cgalConcept

The concept `MeshVertexBase_3` describes the requirements 
for the `Vertex` type of the triangulation 
used by a 3D mesh generation process. The type `MeshVertexBase_3` refines both the concept `TriangulationVertexBase_3` 
and 
the concept `SurfaceMeshVertexBase_3`. 
It provides additional members to store and retrieve 
information about the location of the vertex with respect 
to the input domain describing the domain to be discretized. 
More specifically, the concept `MeshVertexBase_3` provides read-write access 
to an integer representing the dimension of the lowest dimensional face 
of the input 3D complex on which the vertex lies, 
and to an index characteristic of this face.
