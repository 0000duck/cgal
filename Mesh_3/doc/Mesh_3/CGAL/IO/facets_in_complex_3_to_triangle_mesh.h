//! This function exports the surface as a `TriangleMesh` and appends it to `graph`, using

//! @tparam C3T3 a model of `MeshComplexWithFeatures_3InTriangulation_3`.
//! @tparam TriangleMesh a model of `MutableFaceGraph` with an internal point property map

//! @param c3t3 an instance of `C3T3`.
//! @param graph an instance of `TriangleMesh`.
