\cgalPkgDesc{This package is devoted to the generation of  isotropic simplicial meshes discretizing 3D domains. The domain to be meshed is a region of 3D space that has to be bounded. The region may be connected or  composed of multiple components and/or subdivided in several subdomains.  The domain is input as an oracle able to answer  queries, of a few different types, on the domain. Boundary and subdivision surfaces  are either smooth or piecewise smooth surfaces, formed with planar or curved surface patches. Surfaces may exhibit 1-dimensional features (e.g. crease edges) and 0-dimensional features (e.g. singular points as corners  tips, cusps or darts), that have to be fairly approximated in the mesh. }
