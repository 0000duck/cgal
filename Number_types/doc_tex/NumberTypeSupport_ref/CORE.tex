\ccDefinition

The class \ccRefName\ provides exact computation over the subset of real
numbers that contains integers, and which is closed by the operations
$+,-,\times,/$ and $\sqrt{}$.  Comparisons between objets of this type
are guaranteed to be exact.  This number type is provided by the
{\sc Core} library~\cite{klpy-clp-99}.

\cgal\ defines the necessary functions so that this class complies to the
requirements on number types.
