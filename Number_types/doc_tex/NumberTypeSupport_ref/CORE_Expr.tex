\ccDefinition

The class \ccRefName\ provides exact computation over the subset of real
numbers that contains integers, and which is closed by the operations
$+,-,\times,/,\sqrt{}$ and $kth\_root$.  Operations and comparisons 
between objects of this type are guaranteed to be exact.  
This number type is provided by the
{\sc Core} library~\cite{klpy-clp-99}.

\cgal\ defines the necessary functions so that this class complies to the
requirements on number types.
