\ccDefinition

The class \ccRefName\ is a wrapper class that provides the functions needed
to use the number type \ccc{real}, representing exact real numbers
numbers provided by \leda. 
The class \ccRefName\ provides exact computation over the subset of real
numbers that contains integers, and which is closed by the operations
$+,-,\times,/,\sqrt{}$ and $kth\_root$. For \leda\ version 5.0 or later 
\ccc{leda_real} is also able to represent real roots of polynomials. 
Operations and comparisons between objects of this type are guaranteed 
to be exact.
