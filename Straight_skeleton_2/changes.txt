14 July 2006 Fernando Cacciola
- Fixed a bug in the detection of events at time zero (which ought to be ignored)

5 July 2006 Fernando Cacciola
- Computation of the coordinates of skeleton nodes now filtered
- Split-events are now clustered into parallel priority-queues to reduce processing time (up to 3 times faster now)

20 June 2006 Fernando Cacciola
- Bug fixes from user report (see pseudo_split_5.poly)
- Vertex-events replaced by Pseudo-split events

26 March 2006 Fernando Cacciola
- Even more fixes for VC8
- More uses of the straight skeleton added to the docs

23 March 2006 Fernando Cacciola
- More fixes for VC8

20 March 2006 Fernando Cacciola
- Coincident-node merging added
- Base class qualification fixed for VC8

16 March 2006 Fernando Cacciola
- Added overflow handling (code and docs)
- Added filter for consecutive coincident points
- Help file for the Demo updated
- Demo extended to allow non-simple polygons (some forms of non-simplicity are supported by the algorithms)

16 March 2006 andreas Fabri
- Added CGAL:: namespace prefix in test_offset_builder.C as ICL had a lookup problem

14 March 2006 Joachim Reichel
