\ccDefinition

The concept \ccRefName\ describes the requirements for the vertex type of the
\ccc{StraightSkeleton_2} concept. It is a refinement of the \ccc{HalfedgeDSVertex} concept
with support for storage of the incident halfedge. The \ccRefName\ concept requires the geometric embedding to be a 2D point.

\ccAccessFunctions
  \ccMethod{int id() const;}{The ID of the vertex.}

  \ccMethod{Point_2 const& point() const;}{The vertex point.}

  \ccMethod{Halfedge_handle primary_bisector();}{}
  \ccGlue
  \ccMethod{Halfedge_const_handle primary_bisector() const;}
{Returns the skeleton halfedge incident upon the vertex (called the \textit{primary} bisector).}
  \ccGlue
  \ccMethod{Halfedge_around_vertex_circulator incident_edges_begin();}{}
  \ccGlue
  \ccMethod{Halfedge_around_vertex_const_circulator incident_edges_begin() const;}
{Returns a bi-directional circulator pointing to one of the incident edges (which one is unspecified).\\
There will always be as many incident edges as the degree of the vertex.\\
If this is a \textit{contour} vertex, its degree is exactly 3, and from the edges pointed to by the circulator, 2 are contour and 1 is a bisector.\\
If this is an \ccc{skeleton} vertex, its degree is at least 3 and all of the edges pointed to by the circulator are bisectors.\\
Only one halfedge of each edge will be pointed to by the circulator: the one which is oriented towards the vertex (according to the geometric embedding).}

  \ccGlue
  \ccMethod{Halfedge_across_incident_faces_const_circulator defining_contour_edges_begin() const;}
{Returns a bi-directional circulator pointing to one of the defining contour edges of the vertex (which one is unspecified).\\
There will always be as many incident defining contour edges as the degree of the vertex.\\
Only one halfedge of each contour edge will be pointed to by the circulator: the one having its left side facing inwards (which happens to be the contour halfedge for which \ccc{is\_border()} is \ccc{false}).}
