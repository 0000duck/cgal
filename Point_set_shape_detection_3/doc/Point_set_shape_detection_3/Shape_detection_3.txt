\section Point_set_shape_detection_3Introduction Introduction

This \cgal component implements the Efficient RANSAC method for primitive shape detection contributed by Schnabel et al. in 2007 \cite cgal:-erpcsd-07. From an unstructured point set with unoriented normals the algorithm detects a set of primitive shapes (see \cgalFigureRef{Point_set_shape_detection_3_overview}). The supported shapes are plane, sphere, cylinder, cone and torus.

\section Point_set_shape_detection_3Method Method
The method takes as input a point set with unoriented normals and provides as output a set of primitive shapes covering all or part of the input points. The shapes are detected via a RANSAC-type approach, i.e., a random sample consensus. The basic RANSAC approach repeats the following steps: (1) Randomly select a subset of the input points. (2) Fit a shape to the selected subset. (3) Count the number of inliers to the shape, that are within a user-specified error tolerance to the shape. Steps 1-3 are repeated for a prescribed number of iterations and the shape with highest number of inliers, referred to as largest shape, is kept. 

In our context, the error between a point and a shape is defined by its distance and normal deviation to the shape. A random subset corresponds to the minimal number of points (with normals) required to uniquely define a primitive.

For very large point sets however the basic RANSAC method is not practical when testing all possible shape candidates against the input data in order to find the largest shape. The main idea behind the Efficient RANSAC method consists in testing shape candidates against \a subsets of the input data. A subset of all possible shape candidates is constructed until the probability to miss the largest candidate is lower than a user-specified parameter. The largest shape is repeatedly extracted until no more shapes, restricted to cover a minimum number of points, can be extracted. An additional gain in efficiency is achieved through exploiting the normal attributes during initial shape construction and enumeration of inliers.

The \a support of a shape refers to the footprint of the points covered by the primitive. To avoid generating shapes with fragmented support we impose a connectivity constraint by considering only one connected component, referred to as cluster, selected as the one covering the largest number of inliers. See section \ref Point_set_shape_detection_3Parameters for more details.

The output of the shape detection algorithm is a set of detected shapes with associated points, and all remaining points not covered by shapes. Each input point can be assigned to at most one detected shape. 

\section Point_set_shape_detection_3Parameters Parameters
The algorithm requires five parameters:
- \f$epsilon\f$ and \f$normal\, deviation\f$:
The error between a point-with-normal \f$p\f$ and a shape \f$S\f$ is defined by its Euclidean distance and normal deviation to \f$S\f$. The normal deviation is computed between the normal at \f$p\f$ and the normal to \f$S\f$ at the closest projection of \f$p\f$ onto \f$S\f$. Parameter \f$epsilon\f$ defines the maximum tolerance Euclidean distance between a point and a shape. A high value for \f$epsilon\f$ leads to the detection of fewer large shapes and hence a less detailed detection. A low value for \f$epsilon\f$ yields a more detailed detection, but may lead to either lower coverage or over-segmentation. Over-segmentation translates into detection of fragmented shapes when \f$epsilon\f$ is within or below the noise level. When the input point set is made of free-form parts, a higher tolerance \f$epsilon\f$ allows for detecting more primitive shapes that approximate some of the free-form surfaces. The impact of this parameter is depicted by Figure \cgalFigureRef{Point_set_shape_detection_3_parameter_epsilon_variation}. Its impact on performance is evaluated in Section \ref Point_set_shape_detection_3Performance.

Most details such as chimneys on the roof are not distinguished. Middle right:  detection with epsilon set to 0.5. The facades are correctly detected and some details of the roof are detected. Right: setting epsilon to 0.25 yields a more detailed but slightly over-segmented detection.

- \f$cluster\_epsilon\f$:
Clustering of the points into connected components covered by a detected shape is controlled via parameter \f$cluster\_epsilon\f$. The points covered by a shape are mapped to a 2D parameter space chosen to minimize distortion and best preserve arc-length distances. This 2D parameter space is discretized using a regular grid, and a connected component search is performed to identify the largest cluster. Parameter \f$cluster_epsilon\f$ defines the spacing between two cells of the regular grid, so that two points separated by a distance of at most \f$2\sqrt{2}\, cluster\_epsilon\f$ are considered adjacent. The impact of parameter cluster_epsilon is depicted by Figure \cgalFigureRef{Point_set_shape_detection_3_parameter_connectivity}. 
\cgalFigureBegin{Point_set_shape_detection_3_parameter_connectivity,varying_connectivity.png}
Parameter cluster_epsilon controls the connectivity of the points covered by a detected shape. The input point set is sampled on four coplanar squares. Left: a large value for cluster_epsilon leads to detecting a single planar shape. Middle: a middle value for cluster_epsilon yields the detection of four squares. Notice that few points within the squares are not detected as not connected. Right: a small value for cluster_epsilon leads to over-segmentation.

- \f$probability\f$:
This parameter defines the probability to miss the largest candidate shape. A lower probability provides a higher reliability and determinism at the cost of longer running times due to higher search endurance. 

- \f$minimum\, number\, of\, points\f$:
This minimum number of points controls the termination of the algorithm. The shape search is iterated until no further shapes can be found with a higher support. Note that this parameter is not strict: depending on the chosen probability, shapes may be extracted with a number of points lower than the specified parameter.

\section Point_set_shape_detection_3Usage Usage
The main class `Shape_detection_3` takes a template parameter `Shape_detection_traits_3` that defines the geometric types and input format. Property maps provide a means to interface with user-specific data structures. The first parameter of the `Shape_detection_traits_3` class is the common Kernel. In order to match the constraints of property maps, an iterator type and two maps that map an iterator to a point and a normal are specified in the `Shape_detection_traits_3` class. The concept behind property maps is detailed in Chapter \ref chapterProperty_map.

Typical usage consists in five steps:

-# Provide input data via a range iterator
-# Register shape factories
-# Choose parameters 
-# Detect
-# Retrieve detected shapes

\subsection Point_set_shape_detection_3Usage_minimal Basic planar shape detection

The following minimal example reads a point set from a file and detects only planar shapes. The default parameters are used for detection.

\cgalExample{Point_set_shape_detection_3/shape_detection_3_basic.cpp}

\subsection Point_set_shape_detection_3Usage_parameters Setting parameters and using different types of shape

This example illustrates the user selection of parameters using the `Shape_detection::Parameters` struct. Shape detection is extended to all types of shape. A basic output of the detected shapes is provided after processing. The input point set is sampled on a surface mostly composed of piece-wise planar and cylindrical parts, in addition to free-form parts.

\cgalExample{Point_set_shape_detection_3/shape_detection_3_parameters.cpp}

\subsection Point_set_shape_detection_3Usage_point_access Retrieving points associated to shapes

This example illustrates how to access the points assigned to each shape and compute the mean error. A timer measures the running performance.

\section Point_set_shape_detection_3Performance Performance
 
The running time and detection performance depend on the chosen parameters. A selective error tolerance parameter leads to higher running times and smaller shapes, as many shape candidates are generated to find the largest shape. We plot the detection performance against the epsilon error tolerance parameter for detecting planes in a complex scene with 5M points, see \cgalFigureRef{Point_set_shape_detection_3_performace_epsilon}. The probability parameter controls the endurance when searching for the largest candidate at each iteration. It barely impacts the number of detected shapes, has a moderate impact on the size of the detected shapes and increases the running times. We plot the performance against the probability parameter, see \cgalFigureRef{Point_set_shape_detection_3_performace_probability}.

\cgalFigureBegin{Point_set_shape_detection_3_performace_epsilon,epsilon_graph.png}
The graph depicts the number of detected shapes (purple) and the coverage (green), i.e., the ratio assignedPoints / totalPoints, against the epsilon tolerance parameter. A higher value for epsilon, i.e., a more tolerant error, leads to fewer but larger shapes and shorter running times.

\cgalFigureBegin{Point_set_shape_detection_3_performace_probability,prob_graph.png}
The graph depicts the time, coverage and number of detected primitives against the search endurance parameter, i.e., the probability to miss the largest shape at each iteration. The number of shapes is stable and the coverage increases when the probability is lowered. The running times increase significantly as many more candidates are generated during each iteration of the algorithm.
